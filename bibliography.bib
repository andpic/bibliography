  abstract  = {The need to determine pseudoperipheral vertices arises from several graph-theoretical approaches for ordering sparse matrix equations. The results of two algorithms for finding such vertices, namely, the George-Liu and Kaveh-Bondarabady algorithms, are evaluated in this work along with a variant of the Kaveh-Bondarabady algorithm. The results suggest that the well-know George-Liu algorithm dominates the other two pseudoperipheral vertex finders mainly when considering the computational times of the algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Sparse triangular linear systems are ubiquitous in a wide range of science and engineering fields, and represent one of the most important building blocks of Sparse Numerical Lineal Algebra methods. For this reason, their parallel solution has been subject of exhaustive study, and efficient implementations of this kernel can be found for almost every hardware platform. However, the strong data dependencies that serialize a great deal of the execution and the load imbalance inherent to the triangular structure poses serious difficulties for its parallel performance, specially in the context of massively- parallel processors such as GPUs. To this day, the most widespread GPU implementation of this kernel is the one distributed in NVIDIA CUSPARSE library, which relies on a preprocessing stage to determine the parallel execution schedule. Although the solution phase is highly efficient, this strategy pays the cost of constant synchronizations with the CPU. In this work, we present a synchronization-free GPU al- gorithm to solve sparse triangular linear systems for the CSR format. The experimental evaluation shows performance improvements over CUSPARSE and a recently proposed synchronization-free method for the CSC matrix format.},

  abstract    = {This thesis introduces the novel paradigm of constraint integer programming (CIP), which integrates constraint programming (CP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) modeling and solving techniques. It is supplemented by the software SCIP, which is a solver and framework for constraint integer programming that also features SAT solving techniques. SCIP is freely available in source code for academic and non-commercial purposes. \\ Our constraint integer programming approach is a generalization of MIP that allows for the inclusion of arbitrary constraints, as long as they turn into linear constraints on the continuous variables after all integer variables have been fixed. The constraints, may they be linear or more complex, are treated by any combination of CP and MIP techniques: the propagation of the domains by constraint specific algorithms, the generation of a linear relaxation and its solving by LP methods, and the strengthening of the LP by cutting plane separation. \\ The current version of SCIP comes with all of the necessary components to solve mixed integer programs. In the thesis, we cover most of these ingredients and present extensive computational results to compare different variants for the individual building blocks of a MIP solver. We focus on the algorithms and their impact on the overall performance of the solver. \\ In addition to mixed integer programming, the thesis deals with chip design verification, which is an important topic of electronic design automation. Chip manufacturers have to make sure that the logic design of a circuit conforms to the specification of the chip. Otherwise, the chip would show an erroneous behavior that may cause failures in the device where it is employed. An important subproblem of chip design verification is the property checking problem, which is to verify whether a circuit satisfies a specified property. We show how this problem can be modeled as constraint integer program and provide a number of problem-specific algorithms that exploit the structure of the individual constraints and the circuit as a whole. Another set of extensive computational benchmarks compares our CIP approach to the current state-of-the-art SAT methodology and documents the success of our method.},

This approach employs a partitioned representation of the inverse of the triangular matrix so that the solution can be computed by matrix-vector multiplication. The number of factors in the partitioned inverse is proportional to the number of general communication steps (router steps on a CM-2) required in a highly parallel algorithm. We describe partitioning algorithms that minimize the number of factors in the partitioned inverse over all symmetric permutations of the triangular matrix such that the permuted matrix continues to be triangular. For a Cholesky factor we describe an O(n) time and space algorithm to solve the partitioning problem above, where n is the order of the matrix. Our computational results on a CM-2 demonstrate the potential superiority of the partitioned inverse approach over the conventional substitution algorithm for highly parallel sparse triangular solution. Finally we describe current and future extensions of these results.},

We propose to split the optimization of the original problem into the optimization of several subproblems that can be optimized separately with the goal that the amount of work that each processor carries out is balanced between the processors, while achieving interesting speedups. The main innovation of our approach consists in the use of machine learning to create a function able to estimate the difficulty (number of nodes) of a subproblem of the original problem. We also present a set of features that we developed in order to characterize the encountered subproblems. These features are used as input of the function learned with machine learning in order to estimate the difficulty of a subproblem. The estimates of the numbers of nodes are then used to decide how to partition the original optimization tree into a given number of subproblems, and to decide how to distribute them among the available processors. The experiments that we carry out show that our approach succeeds in balancing the amount of work between the processors, and that interesting speedups can be achieved with little effort.},

  abstract    = {Parallel processors have become ubiquitous; most programmers today have access to parallel hardware such as multi-core processors and graphics processors. This has created an implementation gap, where efficiency programmers with knowledge of hardware details can attain high performance by exploiting parallel hardware, while productivity programmers with application-level knowledge may not understand low-level performance trade-offs. Ideally, we would like to be able to write programs in productivity languages such as Python or MATLAB, and achieve performance comparable to the best hand-tuned code. \\One approach toward achieving this ideal is to write libraries that get high efficiency on certain operations, and call these libraries from the productivity environment. We propose a framework that addresses two problems with this approach: that it fails to fuse operations for efficiency, and that it may not consider runtime information such as shapes and sizes of data structures. With our framework, efficiency programmers write and/or generate customized OpenCL snippets at runtime and the framework automatically fuses, compiles, and executes these operations based on a Python description. \\We evaluate the framework with case studies of two very different applications: space-time adaptive radar processing and optical flow. For a space-time adaptive radar processing application, our framework's implementation is competitive with a hand-coded implementation that uses a vendor-optimized library. For optical flow, a computer vision application, the framework achieves frame rates that are between 0.5$\times$ and 0.97$\times$ hand-coded OpenCL performance.},

In this work, we present the first implementation of the 3D SpGEMM formulation that exploits multiple (intranode and internode) levels of parallelism, achieving significant speedups over the state-of-the-art publicly available codes at all levels of concurrencies. We extensively evaluate our implementation and identify bottlenecks that should be subject to further research.}

The combination of multiple, multithreaded, SIMD cores makes studying these GPUs useful in understanding tradeoffs among memory, data, and thread level parallelism. While modern GPUs offer orders of magnitude more raw computing power than contemporary CPUs, many important applications, even those with abundant data level parallelism, do not achieve peak performance. This paper characterizes several non-graphics applications written in NVIDIA's CUDA programming model by running them on a novel detailed microarchitecture performance simulator that runs NVIDIA's parallel thread execution (PTX) virtual instruction set. For this study, we selected twelve non-trivial CUDA applications demonstrating varying levels of performance improvement on GPU hardware (versus a CPU-only sequential version of the application). We study the performance of these applications on our GPU performance simulator with configurations comparable to contemporary high-end graphics cards. We characterize the performance impact of several microarchitecture design choices including choice of interconnect topology, use of caches, design of memory controller, parallel workload distribution mechanisms, and memory request coalescing hardware. Two observations we make are (1) that for the applications we study, performance is more sensitive to interconnect bisection bandwidth rather than latency, and (2) that, for some applications, running fewer threads concurrently than on-chip resources might otherwise allow can improve performance by reducing contention in the memory system.},

  abstract    = {We are witnessing the emergence of Graphics Processor units (GPUs) as powerful massively parallel systems. Furthermore, the introduction of new APIs for general-purpose computations on GPUs, namely CUDA from NVIDIA, Stream SDK from AMD, and OpenCL, makes GPUs an attractive choice for high-performance numerical and scientific computing. Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication (SpMV) is one of the most important and heavily used kernels in scientific computing. However with indirect and irregular memory accesses resulting in more memory accesses per floating point operation, optimization of SpMV kernel is a significant challenge in any architecture. \\ In this paper, we evaluate the various challenges in developing a high-performance SpMV kernel on NVIDIA GPUs using the CUDA programming model and propose a framework that employs both compile-time and run-time optimizations. The compile-time optimizations include: (1) exploiting synchronization-free parallelism, (2) optimized thread mapping based on the affinity towards optimal memory access pattern, (3) optimized off-chip memory access to tolerate the high latency, and (4) exploiting data reuse. The runtime optimizations involve a runtime inspection of the sparse matrix to determine dense non-zero sub-blocks, which facilitate the reuse of input vector elements while execution. We propose a new blocked storage format for storing and accessing elements of a sparse matrix in an optimized manner from the GPU memories. We evaluate our optimizations over two classes of NVIDIA GPU chips, namely, GeForce 8800 GTX and GeForce GTX 280, and we compare the performance of our approach with that of existing parallel SpMV implementations such as the one from NVIDIA's CUDPP library and the one implemented using optimal segmented scan primitive. Our approach outperforms the other existing implementations by a factor of 2 to 4. Using our framework, we achieve a peak SpMV performance that is 70\% of the performance observed for SpMV computations using dense matrices stored in sparse format.},

These decision problems lead to mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems that combine the combinatorial difficulty of optimizing over discrete variable sets with the challenges of handling nonlinear functions. We review models and applications of MINLP, and survey the state of the art in methods for solving this challenging class of problems. \\Most solution methods for MINLP apply some form of tree search. We distinguish two broad classes of methods: single-tree and multitree methods. We discuss these two classes of methods first in the case where the underlying problem functions are convex. Classical single-tree methods include nonlinear branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut methods, while classical multitree methods include outer approximation and Benders decomposition. The most efficient class of methods for convex MINLP are hybrid methods that combine the strengths of both classes of classical techniques. \\Non-convex MINLPs pose additional challenges, because they contain non-convex functions in the objective function or the constraints; hence even when the integer variables are relaxed to be continuous, the feasible region is generally non-convex, resulting in many local minima. We discuss a range of approaches for tackling this challenging class of problems, including piecewise linear approximations, generic strategies for obtaining convex relaxations for non-convex functions, spatial branch-and-bound methods, and a small sample of techniques that exploit particular types of non-convex structures to obtain improved convex relaxations. \\We finish our survey with a brief discussion of three important aspects of MINLP. First, we review heuristic techniques that can obtain good feasible solution in situations where the search-tree has grown too large or we require real-time solutions. Second, we describe an emerging area of mixed-integer optimal control that adds systems of ordinary differential equations to MINLP. Third, we survey the state of the art in software for MINLP.},

In this paper, we document the efficiency of the Cilk work-stealing scheduler, both empirically and analytically. We show that on real and synthetic applications, the “work” and “critical path” of a Cilk computation can be used to accurately model performance. Consequently, a Cilk programmer can focus on reducing the work and critical path of his computation, insulated from load balancing and other runtime scheduling issues. We also prove that for the class of “fully strict” (well-structured) programs, the Cilk scheduler achieves space, time and communication bounds all within a constant factor of optimal.The Cilk runtime system currently runs on the Connection Machine CM5 MPP, the Intel Paragon MPP, the Silicon Graphics Power Challenge SMP, and the MIT Phish network of workstations. Applications written in Cilk include protein folding, graphic rendering, backtrack search, and the *Socrates chess program, which won third prize in the 1994 ACM International Computer Chess Championship.},

The solution of a system of linear equations forms the basis of many problems in engineering and science, but its calculation is highly time consuming. The minimum residual algorithm (MINRES) is one method to solve this problem, and is highly effective provided the matrix exhibits certain characteristics. This paper examines an IEEE 754 single precision floating point implementation of the MINRES algorithm on an FPGA. It demonstrates that through parallelisation and heavy pipelining of all floating point components it is possible to achieve a sustained performance of up to 53 GFLOPS on the Virtex5-330T. This compares favourably to other hardware implementations of floating point matrix inversion algorithms, and corresponds to an improvement of nearly an order of magnitude compared to a software implementation.},

The geometric Semicoarsening Multigrid (SMG) method is provided by the hypre parallel software package. We solve linear systems using two variants (standard and flexible) of PCG and preconditioned steepest descent (PSD) methods. The eigen-value problems are solved using the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method available in hypre through BLOPEX software. We observe that turning off the post-smoothing in SMG dramatically slows down the standard PCG-SMG. For flexible PCG and LOBPCG, our numerical tests show that removing the post-smoothing results in overall 40--50 percent acceleration, due to the high costs of smoothing and relatively insignificant decrease in convergence speed. We demonstrate that PSD-SMG and flexible PCG-SMG converge similarly if SMG post-smoothing is off. A theoretical justification is provided.},

Portability is the second challenge to be met in this context. In this paper we present our library LAMA. We created this library to address both challenges successfully in the realm of linear algebra and numerical mathematics. We introduce our solutions to heterogeneous memory and kernel management as well as our solutions to task parallelism.

One key factor in achieving the best performance possible from HC environments is the ability to assign effectively the applications to machines and schedule their execution. Several factors must be considered during this assignment. A conceptual model for the automatic decomposition of an application into tasks and assignment of tasks to machines is presented. An example of a static matching and scheduling approach for an HC environment is summarized. Some examples of current HC technology and open research problems are discussed.},

This paper presents algorithms for the Cholesky, LU and QR factorization where the operations can be represented as a sequence of small tasks that operate on square blocks of data. These tasks can be dynamically scheduled for execution based on the dependencies among them and on the availability of computational resources. This may result in out of order execution of tasks which will completely hide the presence of intrinsically sequential tasks in the factorization. Performance comparisons are presented with LAPACK algorithms where parallelism can only be exploited at the level of the BLAS operations and vendor implementations.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, research on GPU processor architecture is extraordinarily active since these architectures offer much more performance per watt than CPU architectures. This is the main reason why massive deployment of GPU multiprocessors is considered one of the most feasible solutions to attain exascale computing capabilities. In this context, ongoing GPU architecture research is required to improve GPU programmability as well as to integrate CPU and GPU cores in the same die. One of the most important research topics in current GPUs, is the GPU memory hierarchy, since its design goals are very different from those of conventional CPU memory hierarchies. To explore novel designs to better support General Purpose computing in GPUs (GPGPU computing) as well as to improve the performance of GPU and CPU/GPU systems, researchers often require advanced microarchitectural simulators with detailed models of the memory subsystem. Nevertheless, due to fast speed at which current GPU architectures evolve, simulation accuracy of existing state-of-the-art simulators suffers. This paper focuses on accurately modeling the GPU memory subsystem. We identified three main aspects that should be modeled with more accuracy: i) miss status holding registers, ii) coalescing vector memory requests, and iii) non-blocking GPU stores. In this sense, we extend the Multi2Sim heterogeneous CPU/GPU processor simulator to model these aspects with enough accuracy. Experimental results show that if these aspects are not considered in the simulation framework, performance deviations can rise in some applications up to 70\%, 75\%, and 60\%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Research on GPU architecture is becoming pervasive in both the academia and the industry because these architectures offer much more performance per watt than typical CPU architectures. This is the main reason why massive deployment of GPU multiprocessors is considered one of the most feasible solutions to attain exascale computing capabilities. \\The memory hierarchy of the GPU is a critical research topic, since its design goals widely differ from those of conventional CPU memory hierarchies. Researchers typically use detailed microarchitectural simulators to explore novel designs to better support GPGPU computing as well as to improve the performance of GPU and CPU-GPU systems. In this context, the memory hierarchy is a critical and continuously evolving subsystem. \\Unfortunately, the fast evolution of current memory subsystems deteriorates the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art simulators. This paper focuses on accurately modeling the entire (both on-chip and off-chip) GPU memory subsystem. For this purpose, we identify four main memory related components that impact on the overall performance accuracy. Three of them belong to the on-chip memory hierarchy: (i) memory request coalescing mechanisms, (ii) miss status holding registers, and (iii) cache coherence protocol; while the fourth component refers to the memory controller and GDDR memory working activity. \\To evaluate and quantify our claims, we accurately modeled the aforementioned memory components in an extended version of the state-of-the-art Multi2Sim heterogeneous CPU-GPU processor simulator. Experimental results show important deviations, which can vary the final system performance provided by the simulation framework up to a factor of three. The proposed GPU model has been compared and validated against the original framework and the results from a real AMD Southern-Islands 7870HD GPU.},

  abstract  = {Solving exactly Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) using a Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) algorithm requires a huge amount of computational resources. Therefore, we recently investigated designing B\&B algorithms on top of graphics processing units (GPUs) using a parallel bounding model. The proposed model assumes parallelizing the evaluation of the lower bounds on pools of sub-problems. The results demonstrated that the size of the evaluated pool has a significant impact on the performance of B\&B and that it depends strongly on the problem instance being solved. In this paper, we design an adaptative parallel B\&B algorithm for solving permutation-based combinatorial optimization problems such as FSP (Flow-shop Scheduling Problem) on GPU accelerators. To do so, we propose a dynamic heuristic for parameter auto-tuning at runtime. Another challenge of this pioneering work is to exploit larger degrees of parallelism by using the combined computational power of multiple GPU devices. The approach has been applied to the permutation flow-shop problem. Extensive experiments have been carried out on well-known FSP benchmarks using an Nvidia Tesla S1070 Computing System equipped with two Tesla T10 GPUs. Compared to a CPU-based execution, accelerations up to 105 are achieved for large problem instances.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we revisit the design and implementation of Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) algorithms for solving large combinatorial optimization problems on GPU-enhanced multi-core machines. B\&B is a tree-based optimization method that uses four operators (selection, branching, bounding and pruning) to build and explore a highly irregular tree representing the solution space. In our previous works, we have proposed a GPU-accelerated approach in which only a single CPU core is used and only the bounding operator is performed on the GPU device. Here, we extend the approach (LL-GB\&B) in order to minimize the CPU-GPU communication latency and thread divergence. Such an objective is achieved through a GPU-based fine-grained parallelization of the branching and pruning operators in addition to the bounding one. The second contribution consists in investigating the combination of a GPU with multi-core processing. Two scenarios have been explored leading to two approaches: a concurrent (RLL-GB\&B) and a cooperative one (PLL-GB\&B). In the first one, the exploration process is performed concurrently by the GPU and the CPU cores. In the cooperative approach, the CPU cores prepare and off-load to GPU pools of tree nodes using data streaming while the GPU performs the exploration. The different approaches have been extensively experimented on the Flowshop scheduling problem. Compared to a single CPU-based execution, LL-GB\&B allows accelerations up to ($\times$160) for large problem instances. Moreover, when combining multi-core and GPU, we figure out that using RLL-GB\&B is not beneficial while PLL-GB\&B enables an improvement up to 36\% compared to LL-GB\&B.},

  abstract  = {GPUs have become popular recently to accelerate general-purpose data-parallel applications. However, most existing work has focused on GPU-friendly applications with regular data structures and access patterns. While a few prior studies have shown that some irregular workloads can also achieve speedups on GPUs, this domain has not been investigated thoroughly. Graph applications are one such set of irregular workloads, used in many commercial and scientific domains. In particular, graph mining -as well as web and social network analysis- are promising applications that GPUs could accelerate. However, implementing and optimizing these graph algorithms on SIMD architectures is challenging because their data-dependent behavior results in significant branch and memory divergence. To address these concerns and facilitate research in this area, this paper presents and characterizes a suite of GPGPU graph applications, Pannotia, which is implemented in OpenCL and contains problems from diverse and important graph application domains. We perform a first-step characterization and analysis of these benchmarks and study their behavior on real hardware. We also use clustering analysis to illustrate the similarities and differences of the applications in the suite. Finally, we make architectural and scheduling suggestions that will improve their execution efficiency on GPUs.},

  abstract    = {CG, MINRES, and SYMMLQ are Krylov subspace methods for solving large symmetric systems of linear equations. CG (the conjugate-gradient method) is reliable on positive-definite systems, while MINRES and SYMMLQ are designed for indefinite systems. When these methods are applied to an inconsistent system (that is, a singular symmetric least-squares problem), CG could break down and SYMMLQ's solution could explode, while MINRES would give a least-squares solution but not necessarily the minimum-length solution (often called the pseudoinverse solution). This understanding motivates us to design a MINRES-like algorithm to compute minimum-length solutions to singular symmetric systems. \\MINRES uses QR factors of the tridiagonal matrix from the Lanczos process (where R is upper-tridiagonal). Our algorithm uses a QLP decomposition (where rotations on the right reduce R to lower-tridiagonal form), and so we call it MINRES-QLP. On singular or nonsingular systems, MINRES-QLP can give more accurate solutions than MINRES or SYMMLQ. We derive preconditioned MINRES-QLP, new stopping rules, and better estimates of the solution and residual norms, the matrix norm and condition number. \\For a singular matrix of arbitrary shape, we observe that null vectors can be obtained by solving least-squares problems involving the transpose of the matrix. For sparse rectangular matrices, this suggests an application of the iterative solver LSQR. In the square case, MINRES, MINRES-QLP, or LSQR are applicable. Results are given for solving homogeneous systems, computing the stationary probability vector for Markov Chain models, and finding null vectors for sparse systems arising in helioseismology.},

  abstract  = {Processing elements such as CPUs and GPUs depend on cache technology to bridge the classic processor memory subsystem performance gap. As GPUs evolve into general purpose co-processors with CPUs sharing the load, good cache design and use becomes increasingly important. While both CPUs and GPUs must cooperate and perform well, their memory access patterns are very different. On CPUs only a few threads access memory simultaneously. On GPUs, there is significantly higher memory access contention among thousands of threads. Despite such different behavior, there is little research that investigates the behavior and performance of GPU caches in depth. In this paper, we present our extensive study on the characterization and improvement of GPU cache behavior and performance for general-purpose workloads using a cycle-accurate ISA level GPU architectural simulator that models one of the latest GPU architectures, Graphics Core Next (GCN) from AMD. Our study makes the following observations and improvements. First, we observe that L1 vector data cache hit rate is substantially lower when compared to CPU caches. The main culprit is compulsory misses caused by lack of data reuse among massively simultaneous threads. Second, there is significant memory access contention in shared L2 data cache, accounting for up to 19\% of total access for some benchmarks. This high contention remains a main performance barrier in L2 data cache even though its hit rate is high. Third, we demonstrate that memory access coalescing plays a critical role in reducing memory traffic. Finally we found that there exists inter-workgroup locality which can affect the cache behavior and performance. Our experimental results show memory performance can be improved by 1) shared L1 vector data cache where multiple compute units share a single cache to exploit inter-workgroup locality and increase data reusability, and 2) clustered workgroup scheduling where workgroups with consecutive IDs are assigned on the same compute unit.},

Recent research has focused on improving the performance of SpMV on GPUs when using compressed sparse row (CSR), the most frequently used matrix storage format on CPUs. Efficient CSR-based SpMV obviates the need for other GPU-specific storage formats, thereby saving runtime and storage overheads. However, existing CSR-based SpMV algorithms on GPUs perform poorly on irregular sparse matrices, limiting their usefulness. We propose a novel approach for SpMV on GPUs which works well for both regular and irregular matrices while keeping the CSR format intact. We start with CSR-Adaptive, which dynamically chooses between two SpMV algorithms depending on the length of each row. We then add a series of performance improvements, such as a more efficient reduction technique. Finally, we add a third algorithm which uses multiple parallel execution units when operating on irregular matrices with very long rows. Our implementation dynamically assigns the best algorithm to sets of rows in order to ensure that the GPU is efficiently utilized. We effectively double the performance of CSR-Adaptive, which had previously demonstrated better performance than algorithms that use other storage formats. In addition, our implementation is 36\% faster than CSR5, the current state of the art for SpMV on GPUs.},

We address this deficiency and present a new unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal method based on dense matrix kernels. As in the classical multifrontal method, advantage is taken of repetitive structure in the matrix by factorizing more than one pivot in each frontal matrix, thus enabling the use of Level 2 and Level 3 BLAS.

  abstract     = {We discuss the organization of frontal matrices in multifrontal methods for the solution of large sparse sets of unsymmetric linear equations. In the multifrontal method, work on a frontal matrix can be suspended, the frontal matrix can be stored for later reuse, and a new frontal matrix can be generated. There are thus several frontal matrices stored during the factorization, and one or more of these are assembled (summed) when creating a new frontal matrix. Although this means that arbitrary sparsity patterns can be handled efficiently, extra work is required to sum the frontal matrices together and can be costly because indirect addressing is requred. The (uni)frontal method avoids this extra work by factorizing the matrix with a single frontal matrix. Rows and columns are added to the frontal matrix, and pivot rows and columns are removed. Data movement is simpler, but higher fill-in can result if the matrix cannot be permuted into a variable-band form with small profile. We consider a combined unifrontal/multifrontal algorithm to enable general fill-in reduction orderings to be applied without the data movement of previous multifrontal approaches. We discuss this technique in the context of a code designed for the solution of sparse systems with unsymmetric pattern.},

Odeint is designed in a very flexible way and may be easily adapted for effective use of libraries such as MTL4, VexCL, or ViennaCL, using CUDA or OpenCL technologies. We found that CUDA and OpenCL work equally well for problems of large sizes, while OpenCL has higher overhead for smaller problems.

Nevertheless, designing efficient algorithms for the GPUs usually requires additional time and effort, even for experienced programmers. On the other hand, tridiagonal systems solvers are an important building block for a wide range of applications. In this paper, we present a new tuning parallel proposal in order to generate new tridiagonal systems solvers. This proposal is based on the combination of a new reduction algorithm (Redundant Reduction-RR) with a tuning proposal to generate efficient parallel prefix algorithms on the GPU. Specifically, we present two new solvers combining RR with two GPU efficient parallel prefix patterns. The performance of the resulting proposals was analyzed using three different CUDA GPUs, obtaining an improvement of up to 20.5$\times$ over the CUSPARSE library and 28.9$\times$ over CUDPP.},

A number of compiler transformations have been developed to improve data reuse in cache and registers, thus reducing the total number of direct memory accesses in a program. Until now, however, most data reuse transformations have been static---applied only at compile time. As a result, these transformations cannot be used to optimize irregular and dynamic applications, in which the data layout and data access patterns remain unknown until run time and may even change during the computation.In this paper, we explore ways to achieve better data reuse in irregular and dynamic applications by building on the inspector-executor method used by Saltz for run-time parallelization. In particular, we present and evaluate a dynamic approach for improving both computation and data locality in irregular programs. Our results demonstrate that run-time program transformations can substantially improve computation and data locality and, despite the complexity and cost involved, a compiler can automate such transformations, eliminating much of the associated run-time overhead.},

We present efficient interior point methods tailored to convex multistage problems, a problem class which most relevant MPC problems with linear dynamics can be cast in, and specify important algorithmic details required for a high speed implementation with superior numerical stability. In particular, the presented approach allows for quadratic constraints, which is not supported by existing fast MPC solvers. A categorization of widely used MPC problem formulations into classes of different complexity is given, and we show how the computational burden of certain quadratic or linear constraints can be decreased by a low rank matrix forward substitution scheme. Implementation details are provided that are crucial to obtain high speed solvers. We present extensive numerical studies for the proposed methods and compare our solver to three well-known solver packages, outperforming the fastest of these by a factor 2-5 in speed and 3-70 in code size. Moreover, our solver is shown to be very efficient for large problem sizes and for quadratically constrained QPs, extending the set of systems amenable to advanced MPC formulations on low-cost embedded hardware.},

For instance, they can be used to coordinate execution between concurrent threads, and in turn, assist in constructing complex data structures such as hash tables or implementing GPU-wide barrier synchronization. While the performance of atomic operations has improved substantially on the latest NVIDIA Fermi-based GPUs, system-provided atomic operations still incur significant performance penalties on AMD GPUs. A memory-bound kernel on an AMD GPU, for example, can suffer severe performance degradation when including an atomic operation, even if the atomic operation is never executed. In this paper, we first quantify the performance impact of atomic instructions to application kernels on AMD GPUs. We then propose a novel software-based implementation of atomic operations that can significantly improve the overall kernel performance. We evaluate its performance against the system-provided atomic using two micro-benchmarks and four real applications. The results show that using our software based atomic operations on an AMD GPU can speedup an application kernel by 67-fold over the same application kernel but with the (default) system-provided atomic operations.},

The task of presolving is to reduce the problem size and strengthen the formulation, mainly by eliminating redundant information and exploiting problem structures. The first method fixes continuous singleton columns and extends results known from duality fixing. The second analyzes and exploits pairwise dominance relations between variables, whereas the third detects isolated subproblems and solves them independently. The performance of the presented techniques is demonstrated on two MIP test sets. One contains all benchmark instances from the last three MIPLIB versions, while the other consists of real-world supply chain management problems. The computational results show that the combination of all three presolving techniques almost halves the solving time for the considered supply chain management problems. For the MIPLIB instances we obtain a speedup of 20\% on affected instances while not degrading the performance on the remaining problems.},

Over the last few years, several automated partitioning methodologies, both static as well as dynamic, have been proposed for this purpose. The present work provides an in-depth analysis of control flow divergence and its impact on the quality of such program partitions. We characterize the amount of divergence in a program as an important performance feature and train suitable Machine Learning (ML) based classifiers which statically decide the partitioning of an OpenCL workload for a heterogeneous platform involving a single CPU and a single GPU. Our approach reports improved partitioning results with respect to timing performance when compared with existing approaches for ML based static partitioning of data parallel workloads.},

We extend these ideas to Forrest-Tomlin type update formulas for an LU factorization of the reduced basis matrix, which are suited for efficient implementation within a state-of-the-art simplex solver. The computational advantages of the proposed method apply to pure LP solving as well as to LP-based branch-cut-and-price algorithms. It can easily be integrated into existing simplex codes.},

We then introduce the PowerGraph abstraction which exploits the internal structure of graph programs to address these challenges. Leveraging the PowerGraph abstraction we introduce a new approach to distributed graph placement and representation that exploits the structure of power-law graphs. We provide a detailed analysis and experimental evaluation comparing PowerGraph to two popular graph-parallel systems. Finally, we describe three different implementation strategies for PowerGraph and discuss their relative merits with empirical evaluations on large-scale real-world problems demonstrating order of magnitude gains.},

One thing that cannot be done elegantly on a computer is computing. At least not computing fast. \\In the Matrix Template Library 4 we aim for a natural mathematical notation without sacrifying performance. You can write an expression like $x = y * z$ and the library will perform the according operation: scaling a vector, multiplying a sparse matrix with a dense vector or two sparse matrices. Some operations like dense matrix product use tuned BLAS implementation. In parallel, all described operations in this manual are also realized in C++ so that the library can be used without BLAS and is not limited to types supported by BLAS. For short, general applicability is combined with maximal available performance. We developed new techniques to allow for (1) Unrolling of dynamicly sized data with user-define block and tile sizes; (2) Combining multiple vector assignments in a single statement (and more importingly perform them in one single loop); (3) Storing matrices recursively in a never-before realized generality; (4) Performing operations on recursive and non-recursive matrices recursively; (5) Filling compressed sparse matrices efficiently; and much more. \\The manual still not covers all features and techniques of the library. But it should give you enough information to get started.},

The generic programming approach simultaneously stresses flexibility and efficiency, resulting in a parallel graph library that can adapt to various data structures and communication models while retaining the efficiency of equivalent hand-coded programs.

  abstract     = {This paper presents the design and implementation of a memory scalable parallel symbolic factorization algorithm for general sparse unsymmetric matrices. Our parallel algorithm uses a graph partitioning approach, applied to the graph of $|A|+|A|^T$, to partition the matrix in such a way that is good for sparsity preservation as well as for parallel factorization. The partitioning yields a so-called separator tree which represents the dependencies among the computations. We use the separator tree to distribute the input matrix over the processors using a block cyclic approach and a subtree to subprocessor mapping. The parallel algorithm performs a bottom-up traversal of the separator tree. With a combination of right-looking and left-looking partial factorizations, the algorithm obtains one column structure of L and one row structure of U at each step. The algorithm is implemented in C and MPI. From a performance study on large matrices, we show that the parallel algorithm significantly reduces the memory requirement of the symbolic factorization step, as well as the overall memory requirement of the parallel solver. It also often reduces the runtime of the sequential algorithm, which is already relatively small. In general, the parallel algorithm prevents the symbolic factorization step from being a time or memory bottleneck of the parallel solver.},

Our new data reordering (GPART) finds the graph structure within data accesses and applies hierarchical clustering. Quality partitions are constructed quickly by clustering multiple neighbor nodes with priority on nodes with high degree and repeating a few passes. Overhead is kept low by clustering multiple nodes in each pass and considering only edges between partitions. Our new computation reordering (Z-SORT) treats the values of index arrays as coordinates and reorders corresponding computations in Z-curve order. Applied to dense inputs, Z-SORT achieves performance close to data reordering combined with other computation reordering but without the overhead involved in data reordering. Experiments on irregular scientific codes for a variety of meshes show locality optimization techniques are effective for both sequential and parallelized codes, improving performance by 60-87 percent. GPART achieved within 1-2 percent of the performance of more sophisticated partitioning algorithms, but with one third of the overhead. Z-SORT also yields the performance improvement of 64 percent for dense inputs, which is comparable with data reordering combined with computation reordering},

The KLA paradigm enables the level of asynchrony in parallel graph algorithms to be parametrically varied from none (level-synchronous) to full (asynchronous). The motivation is to improve execution times through an appropriate trade-off between the use of fewer, but more expensive global synchronizations, as in level-synchronous algorithms, and more, but less expensive local synchronizations (and perhaps also redundant work), as in asynchronous algorithms. We show how common patterns in graph algorithms can be expressed in the KLA pardigm and provide techniques for determining k, the number of asynchronous steps allowed between global synchronizations. Results of an implementation of KLA in the STAPL Graph Library show excellent scalability on up to 96K cores and improvements of 10$\times$ or more over level-synchronous and asynchronous versions for graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, PageRank, k-core decomposition and others on certain classes of real-world graphs.},

A parallel reduced precision iterative solver is used to accelerate the solution of the set of linear equations forming the computational bottleneck of the PDIP algorithm. A numerical study of the effect of reducing the number of iterations highlights the effectiveness of the approach.

In recent years, there has been much focus on tuning irregular, task-parallel applications and/or the GPU architecture in order to achieve similar benefits for irregular applications running on GPUs. While most of the previous works have focused on minimizing the effect of control and memory divergence, which are prominent in irregular applications and which degrade the performance, there has been less attention paid to decreasing cache pressure and hence improving performance of applications given the small cache sizes on GPUs. \\In this paper we tackle two problems. First we extract data parallelism from irregular task parallel applications, which we do by subdividing each task into sub tasks at the CPU side and sending these sub tasks to the GPU for execution. By doing so we take advantage of the massive parallelism provided by the GPU. Second, to mitigate the memory demands of many tasks that access irregular data structures, we schedule these subtasks in a way to minimize the memory footprint of each warp running on the GPU. We use our framework with 3 task-parallel algorithms and show that we can achieve significant speedups over optimized GPU code.},

  abstract     = {At the heart of many computations in science and engineering lies the need to efficiently and accurately solve large sparse linear systems of equations. Direct methods are frequently the method of choice because of their robustness, accuracy and potential for use as black-box solvers. In the last few years, there have been many new developments, and a number of new modern parallel general-purpose sparse solvers have been written for inclusion within the HSL mathematical software library. In this paper, we introduce and briefly review these solvers for symmetric sparse systems. We describe the algorithms used, highlight key features (including bit-compatibility and out-of-core working) and then, using problems arising from a range of practical applications, we illustrate and compare their performances. We demonstrate that modern direct solvers are able to accurately solve systems of order 106 in less than 3 minutes on a 16-core machine.}

Efforts have focused on symmetric positive-definite systems for which no pivoting is required, while little progress has been reported for the much harder indefinite case. We address this challenge by designing and developing a sparse symmetric indefinite solver SSIDS. This new library-quality $LDL^T$ factorization is designed for use on GPU architectures and incorporates threshold partial pivoting within a multifrontal approach. Both the factorize and the solve phases are performed using the GPU. Another important feature is that the solver produces bit-compatible results. Numerical results for indefinite problems arising from a range of practical applications demonstrate that, for large problems, SSIDS achieves performance improvements of up to a factor of 4.6$\times$ compared with a state-of-the-art multifrontal solver on a multicore CPU.},

In this paper we describe Green-Marl, a domain-specific language (DSL) whose high level language constructs allow developers to describe their graph analysis algorithms intuitively, but expose the data-level parallelism inherent in the algorithms. We also present our Green-Marl compiler which translates high-level algorithmic description written in Green-Marl into an efficient C++ implementation by exploiting this exposed data-level parallelism. Furthermore, our Green-Marl compiler applies a set of optimizations that take advantage of the high-level semantic knowledge encoded in the Green-Marl DSL. We demonstrate that graph analysis algorithms can be written very intuitively with Green-Marl through some examples, and our experimental results show that the compiler-generated implementation out of such descriptions performs as well as or better than highly-tuned hand-coded implementations.},

Programming thousands of massively parallel threads is a big challenge for software engineers, but understanding the performance bottlenecks of those parallel programs on GPU architectures to improve application performance is even more difficult. Current approaches rely on programmers to tune their applications by exploiting the design space exhaustively without fully understanding the performance characteristics of their applications. \\To provide insights into the performance bottlenecks of parallel applications on GPU architectures, we propose a simple analytical model that estimates the execution time of massively parallel programs. The key component of our model is estimating the number of parallel memory requests (we call this the memory warp parallelism) by considering the number of running threads and memory bandwidth. Based on the degree of memory warp parallelism, the model estimates the cost of memory requests, thereby estimating the overall execution time of a program. Comparisons between the outcome of the model and the actual execution time in several GPUs show that the geometric mean of absolute error of our model on micro-benchmarks is 5.4\% and on GPU computing applications is 13.3\%. All the applications are written in the CUDA programming language.},

Performance optimization for multi-core processors has been a challenge for programmers. Furthermore, optimizing for power consumption is even more difficult. Unfortunately, as a result of the high number of processors, the power consumption of many-core processors such as GPUs has increased significantly. \\Hence, in this paper, we propose an integrated power and performance (IPP) prediction model for a GPU architecture to predict the optimal number of active processors for a given application. The basic intuition is that when an application reaches the peak memory bandwidth, using more cores does not result in performance improvement. \\We develop an empirical power model for the GPU. Unlike most previous models, which require measured execution times, hardware performance counters, or architectural simulations, IPP predicts execution times to calculate dynamic power events. We then use the outcome of IPP to control the number of running cores. We also model the increases in power consumption that resulted from the increases in temperature. \\With the predicted optimal number of active cores, we show that we can save up to 22.09\%of runtime GPU energy consumption and on average 10.99\% of that for the five memory bandwidth-limited benchmarks.},

The sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) is one of the most used kernel in scientific computing and is the main performance source of iterative methods. We propose an evaluation and optimization of several sparse formats for the SpMV kernel which have succeeded at the time of data parallel computer. This study is realized by analyzing the performances following the distribution of the non zeros values in the matrix to determine the best and the worst reachable value. The results show that all sparse formats converge to the same efficiency and perform poorly with a strong distribution of elements.},

The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users' typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

At the core of this phenomenon are massively multithreaded, data-parallel architectures possessing impressive acceleration ratings, offering low-cost supercomputing together with attractive power budgets. Even given the numerous benefits provided by GPGPUs, there remain a number of barriers that delay wider adoption of these architectures. One major issue is the heterogeneous and distributed nature of the memory subsystem commonly found on data-parallel architectures. Application acceleration is highly dependent on being able to utilize the memory subsystem effectively so that all execution units remain busy. In this paper, we present techniques for enhancing the memory efficiency of applications on data-parallel architectures, based on the analysis and characterization of memory access patterns in loop bodies; we target vectorization via data transformation to benefit vector-based architectures (e.g., AMD GPUs) and algorithmic memory selection for scalar-based architectures (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods with kernels from a wide range of benchmark suites. For the benchmark kernels studied, we achieve consistent and significant performance improvements (up to 11.4$\times$ and 13.5$\times$ over baseline GPU implementations on each platform, respectively) by applying our proposed methodology.},

  abstract  = {Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced industrial control technique that relies on the solution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem at every sampling instant to determine the input action required to control the current and future behaviour of a physical system. Its ability in handling large multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with physical constraints has led to very successful applications in slow processes, where there is sufficient time for solving the optimization problem between sampling instants. The application of MPC to faster systems, which adds the requirement of greater sampling frequencies, relies on new ways of finding faster solutions to QP problems. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are specially well suited for this application due to the large amount of computation for a small amount of I/O. In addition, unlike a software implementation, an FPGA can provide the precise timing guarantees required for interfacing the controller to the physical system. We present a high-throughput floating-point FPGA implementation that exploits the parallelism inherent in interior-point optimization methods. It is shown that by considering that the QPs come from a control formulation, it is possible to make heavy use of the sparsity in the problem to save computations and reduce memory requirements by 75\%. The implementation yields a 6.5$\times$ improvement in latency and a 51$\times$ improvement in throughput for large problems over a software implementation running on a general purpose microprocessor.},

However, fixed point arithmetic presents additional challenges, such as having to bound peak values of variables and constrain their dynamic ranges. For these types of algorithms the problems cannot be automated by current tools.

Algorithms for solving linear equations, finding eigen values or finding singular values are typically nonlinear and recursive making the problem of establishing analytical bounds on variable dynamic range non-trivial. Current approaches fail to provide tight bounds for this type of algorithms. We use as a case study one of the most important kernels in scientific computing, the Lanczos iteration, which lies at the heart of well known methods such as conjugate gradient and minimum residual, and we show how we can modify the algorithm to allow us to apply standard linear algebra analysis to prove tight analytical bounds on all variables of the process, regardless of the properties of the original matrix. It is shown that the numerical behaviour of fixed-point implementations of the modified problem can be chosen to be at least as good as a double precision floating point implementation. Using this approach it is possible to get sustained FPGA performance very close to the peak general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) performance in FPGAs of comparable size when solving a single problem. If there are several independent problems to solve simultaneously it is possible to exceed the peak floating-point performance of a GPGPU, obtaining approximately 1, 2 or 4 TFLOPs for error tolerances of $10^-7$, $10^-5$ and $10^-3$, respectively, in a large Virtex 7 FPGA.},

In this paper we present the first field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of a fast gradient solver for linear-quadratic MPC problems with input constraints. We use fixed-point arithmetic to exploit the characteristics of the computing platform and provide analytical guarantees ensuring no overflow errors occur during operation. We further prove that the arithmetic errors due to round-off can lead only to reduced accuracy, but not instability, of the fast gradient method. The results are demonstrated on a model of an industrial atomic force microscope (AFM) where we show that, on a low-end FPGA, satisfactory control performance at a sample rate beyond 1 MHz is achievable, opening up new possibilities for the application of MPC.},

We present a performance analysis of the main two-sided factorizations used in these reductions: the bidiagonalization, tridiagonalization, and the upper Hessenberg factorizations on heterogeneous systems of multicore CPUs and Xeon Phi coprocessors. We derive a performance model and use it to guide the analysis and to evaluate performance. We develop optimized implementations for these methods that get up to 80\% of the optimal performance bounds. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous multicore and coprocessor development considerations and the techniques that enable us to achieve these high-performance results. The work here presents the first highly optimized implementation of these main factorizations for Xeon Phi coprocessors.

From the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not knownif they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. We also present a much faster variation of the Kernighan--Lin (KL) algorithm for refining during uncoarsening. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that our scheme produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller time. Also, when our scheme is used to compute fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it produces orderings that have substantially smaller fill than the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm.},

  abstract  = {General-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) are at their best in accelerating computation by exploiting abundant thread-level parallelism (TLP) offered by many classes of HPC applications. To facilitate such high TLP, emerging programming models like CUDA and OpenCL allow programmers to create work abstractions in terms of smaller work units, called cooperative thread arrays (CTAs). CTAs are groups of threads and can be executed in any order, thereby providing ample opportunities for TLP. The state-of-the-art GPGPU schedulers allocate maximum possible CTAs per-core (limited by available on-chip resources) to enhance performance by exploiting TLP. However, we demonstrate in this paper that executing the maximum possible number of CTAs on a core is not always the optimal choice from the performance perspective. High number of concurrently executing threads might cause more memory requests to be issued, and create contention in the caches, network and memory, leading to long stalls at the cores. To reduce resource contention, we propose a dynamic CTA scheduling mechanism, called DYNCTA, which modulates the TLP by allocating optimal number of CTAs, based on application characteristics. To minimize resource contention, DYNCTA allocates fewer CTAs for applications suffering from high contention in the memory sub-system, compared to applications demonstrating high throughput. Simulation results on a 30-core GPGPU platform with 31 applications show that the proposed CTA scheduler provides 28\% average improvement in performance compared to the existing CTA scheduler.},

Computing systems rely on the use of feedback algorithms to schedule tasks, data and resources, but the models that are used to design these algorithms are validated using open-loop metrics. By using closed-loop metrics instead, such as the gap metric developed in the control community, it should be possible to develop improved scheduling algorithms and computing systems that have not been over-engineered. Furthermore, scheduling problems are most naturally formulated as constraint satisfaction or mathematical optimization problems, but these are seldom implemented using state of the art numerical methods, nor do they explicitly take into account the fact that the scheduling problem itself takes time to solve. This paper makes the case that recent results in real-time model predictive control, where optimization problems are solved in order to control a process that evolves in time, are likely to form the basis of scheduling algorithms of the future. We therefore outline some of the research problems and opportunities that could arise by explicitly considering feedback and time when designing optimal scheduling algorithms for computing systems.},

The high compute power provided by SIMT architecture presents an opportunity for accelerating these algorithms using GPUs. Prior works of graph processing on a GPU employ Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) form for its space-efficiency; however, CSR suffers from irregular memory accesses and GPU underutilization that limit its performance. In this paper, we present CuSha, a CUDA-based graph processing framework that overcomes the above obstacle via use of two novel graph representations: G-Shards and Concatenated Windows (CW). G-Shards uses a concept recently introduced for non-GPU systems that organizes a graph into autonomous sets of ordered edges called shards. CuSha's mapping of GPU hardware resources on to shards allows fully coalesced memory accesses. CW is a novel representation that enhances the use of shards to achieve higher GPU utilization for processing sparse graphs. Finally, CuSha fully utilizes the GPU power by processing multiple shards in parallel on GPU's streaming multiprocessors. For ease of programming, CuSha allows the user to define the vertex-centric computation and plug it into its framework for parallel processing of large graphs. Our experiments show that CuSha provides significant speedups over the state-of-the-art CSR-based virtual warp-centric method for processing graphs on GPUs.},

We assume that the preconditioner is SPD on each step, and that the condition number of the preconditioned system matrix is bounded above by a constant independent of the step number. We show that the CG method with variable preconditioning under this assumption may not give improvement, compared to the steepest descent (SD) method. We describe the basic theory of CG methods with variable preconditioning with the emphasis on worst case scenarios, and provide complete proofs of all facts not available in the literature. We give a new elegant geometric proof of the SD convergence rate bound. Our numerical experiments, comparing the preconditioned SD and CG methods, not only support and illustrate our theoretical findings, but also reveal two surprising and potentially practically important effects. First, we analyze variable preconditioning in the form of inner-outer iterations. In previous such tests, the unpreconditioned CG inner iterations are applied to an artificial system with some fixed preconditioner as a matrix of coefficients. We test a different scenario, where the unpreconditioned CG inner iterations solve linear systems with the original system matrix A. We demonstrate that the CG-SD inner-outer iterations perform as well as the CG-CG inner-outer iterations in these tests. Second, we compare the CG methods using a two-grid preconditioning with fixed and randomly chosen coarse grids, and observe that the fixed preconditioner method is twice as slow as the method with random preconditioning.},

  abstract     = {Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (spMVM) is the most time-consuming kernel in many numerical algorithms and has been studied extensively on all modern processor and accelerator architectures. However, the optimal sparse matrix data storage format is highly hardware-specific, which could become an obstacle when using heterogeneous systems. Also, it is as yet unclear how the wide single instruction multiple data (SIMD) units in current multi- and many-core processors should be used most efficiently if there is no structure in the sparsity pattern of the matrix. We suggest SELL-$C$-$\sigma$, a variant of Sliced ELLPACK, as a SIMD-friendly data format which combines long-standing ideas from general-purpose graphics processing units and vector computer programming. We discuss the advantages of SELL-$C$-$\sigma$ compared to established formats like Compressed Row Storage and ELLPACK and show its suitability on a variety of hardware platforms (Intel Sandy Bridge, Intel Xeon Phi, and Nvidia Tesla K20) for a wide range of test matrices from different application areas. Using appropriate performance models we develop deep insight into the data transfer properties of the SELL-$C$-$\sigma$ spMVM kernel. SELL-$C$-$\sigma$ comes with two tuning parameters whose performance impact across the range of test matrices is studied and for which reasonable choices are proposed. This leads to a hardware-independent (``catch-all'') sparse matrix format, which achieves very high efficiency for all test matrices across all hardware platforms.},

  abstract     = {While many of the architectural details of future exascale-class high performance computer systems are still a matter of intense research, there appears to be a general consensus that they will be strongly heterogeneous, featuring standard as well as accelerated resources. Today, such resources are available as multicore processors, graphics processing units (GPUs), and other accelerators such as the Intel Xeon Phi. Any software infrastructure that claims usefulness for such environments must be able to meet their inherent challenges: massive multi-level parallelism, topology, asynchronicity, and abstraction. The General, Hybrid, and Optimized Sparse Toolkit (GHOST) is a collection of building blocks that targets algorithms dealing with sparse matrix representations on current and future large-scale systems. It implements the MPI+X paradigm, has a pure C interface, and provides hybrid-parallel numerical kernels, intelligent resource management, and truly heterogeneous parallelism for multicore CPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and the Intel Xeon Phi. We describe the details of its design with respect to the challenges posed by modern heterogeneous supercomputers and recent algorithmic developments. Implementation details which are indispensable for achieving high efficiency are pointed out and their necessity is justified by performance measurements or predictions based on performance models. We also provide instructions on how to make use of GHOST in existing software packages, together with a case study which demonstrates the applicability and performance of GHOST as a component within a larger software stack. The library code and several applications are available as open source.},

  abstract  = {Until recently, parallel programming has largely focused on the exploitation of data-parallelism in dense matrix programs. However, many important application domains, including meshing, clustering, simulation, and machine learning, have very different algorithmic foundations: they require building, computing with, and modifying large sparse graphs. In the parallel programming literature, these types of applications are usually classified as irregular applications, and relatively little attention has been paid to them. To study and understand the patterns of parallelism and locality in sparse graph computations better, we are in the process of building the Lonestar benchmark suite. In this paper, we characterize the first five programs from this suite, which target domains like data mining, survey propagation, and design automation. We show that even such irregular applications often expose large amounts of parallelism in the form of amorphous data-parallelism. Our speedup numbers demonstrate that this new type of parallelism can successfully be exploited on modern multi-core machines.},

Recent investigations by the Galois project have shown that many irregular programs have a generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism. However, in many programs, amorphous data-parallelism cannot be uncovered using static techniques, and its exploitation requires runtime strategies such as optimistic parallel execution. This raises a natural question: how much amorphous data-parallelism actually exists in irregular programs? \\In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a tool called ParaMeter that produces parallelism profiles for irregular programs. Parallelism profiles are an abstract measure of the amount of amorphous data-parallelism at different points in the execution of an algorithm, independent of implementation-dependent details such as the number of cores, cache sizes, load-balancing, etc. ParaMeter can also generate constrained parallelism profiles for a fixed number of cores. We show parallelism profiles for seven irregular applications, and explain how these profiles provide insight into the behavior of these applications.},

This paper presents an implementation of the algorithm for a hybrid, shared memory, system with standard CPU cores and GPU accelerators. The difficulty of implementing the algorithm for such a system lies in the disproportion between the computational power of the CPUs, compared to the GPUs, and in the meager bandwidth of the communication link between their memory systems. An additional challenge comes from the complexity of the memory-bound and synchronization-rich nature of the panel factorization component of the block LU algorithm, imposed by the use of partial pivoting. The challenges are tackled with the use of a data layout geared toward complex memory hierarchies, autotuning of GPU kernels, fine-grain parallelization of memory-bound CPU operations and dynamic scheduling of tasks to different devices. Performance in excess of one TeraFLOPS is achieved using four AMD Magny Cours CPUs and four NVIDIA Fermi GPUs.},

One of the main benefits of such architecture is its latency-hiding capability. However, the efficacy of GPU's latency-hiding varies significantly across GPGPU applications. \\To investigate this, this paper first proposes a new algorithm that profiles execution behavior of GPGPU applications. We characterize latencies caused by various pipeline hazards, memory accesses, synchronization primitives, and the warp scheduler. Our results show that the current round-robin warp scheduler works well in overlapping various latency stalls with the execution of other available warps for only a few GPGPU applications. For other applications, there is an excessive latency stall that cannot be hidden by the scheduler effectively. With the latency characterization insight, we observe a significant execution time disparity for warps within the same thread block, which causes sub-optimal performance, called the warp criticality problem. \\To tackle the warp criticality problem, we design a family of criticality-aware warp scheduling (CAWS) policies by scheduling the critical warp(s) more frequently than other warps. Our results on the breadth-first-search, B+tree search, two point angular correlation function, and K-means clustering show that, with oracle knowledge of warp criticality, our best-performing scheduling policy can improve GPGPU applications' performance by 17\% on average. With our designed criticality predictor, the various scheduling policies can improve performance by 10-21\% on breadth-first-search. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to characterize warp criticality and explore different criticality-aware warp scheduling policies for GPGPU workloads.},

In the past few years there have been many studies claiming GPUs deliver substantial speedups (between 10$\times$ and 1000$\times$) over multi-core CPUs on these kernels. To understand where such large performance difference comes from, we perform a rigorous performance analysis and find that after applying optimizations appropriate for both CPUs and GPUs the performance gap between an Nvidia GTX280 processor and the Intel Core i7-960 processor narrows to only 2.5$\times$ on average. In this paper, we discuss optimization techniques for both CPU and GPU, analyze what architecture features contributed to performance differences between the two architectures, and recommend a set of architectural features which provide significant improvement in architectural efficiency for throughput kernels.},

L1 data caches (L1 D-caches) are critical resources for providing high-bandwidth and low-latency data accesses. However, the high number of simultaneous requests from single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) cores makes the limited capacity of L1 D-caches a performance and energy bottleneck, especially for memory-intensive applications. We observe that the memory access streams to L1 D-caches for many applications contain a significant amount of requests with low reuse, which greatly reduce the cache efficacy. Existing GPU cache management schemes are either based on conditional/reactive solutions or hit-rate based designs specifically developed for CPU last level caches, which can limit overall performance. \\To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient locality monitoring mechanism to dynamically filter the access stream on cache insertion such that only the data with high reuse and short reuse distances are stored in the L1 D-cache. Specifically, we present a design that integrates locality filtering based on reuse characteristics of GPU workloads into the decoupled tag store of the existing L1 D-cache through simple and cost-effective hardware extensions. Results show that our proposed design can dramatically reduce cache contention and achieve up to 56.8\% and an average of 30.3\% performance improvement over the baseline architecture, for a range of highly-optimized cache-unfriendly applications with minor area overhead and better energy efficiency. Our design also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU bypassing schemes (especially for irregular applications), without generating extra L2 and DRAM level contention.},

  abstract  = {The effective deployment of applications exhibiting irregular nested parallelism on GPUs is still an open problem. A naive mapping of irregular code onto the GPU hardware often leads to resource underutilization and, thereby, limited performance. In this work, we focus on two computational patterns exhibiting nested parallelism: irregular nested loops and parallel recursive computations. In particular, we focus on recursive algorithms operating on trees and graphs. We propose different parallelization templates aimed to increase the GPU utilization of these codes. Specifically, we investigate mechanisms to effectively distribute irregular work to streaming multiprocessors and GPU cores. Some of our parallelization templates rely on dynamic parallelism, a feature recently introduced by Nvidia in their Kepler GPUs and announced as part of the Open CL 2.0 standard. We propose mechanisms to maximize the work performed by nested kernels and minimize the overhead due to their invocation. Our results show that the use of our parallelization templates on applications with irregular nested loops can lead to a 2-6$\times$ speedup over baseline GPU codes that do not include load balancing mechanisms. The use of nested parallelism-based parallelization templates on recursive tree traversal algorithms can lead to substantial speedups (up to 15-24$\times$) over optimized CPU implementations. However, the benefits of nested parallelism are still unclear in the presence of recursive applications operating on graphs, especially when recursive code variants require expensive synchronization. In these cases, a flat parallelization of iterative versions of the considered algorithms may be preferable.},

It aims to improve the computing efficiency when the linear programming problem becomes sufficiently large scale or more complicated. This parallel algorithm, based on Gaussian elimination, uses the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) for computationally intensive tasks such as basis matrix operation, canonical form transformation and entering variable selection. At the same time, CPU is used to control the iteration. Experimental results show that the algorithm is competitive with CPU algorithm and can greatly reduce the computing time, so the GPU-based parallel algorithm is an effective way to solve large scale linear programming problem.},

  abstract  = {Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is an important computational kernel in many applications. For performance improvement, software libraries designated for SpMV computation have been introduced, e.g., MKL library for CPUs and cuSPARSE library for GPUs. However, the computational throughput of these libraries is far below the peak floating-point performance offered by hardware platforms, because the efficiency of SpMV kernel is greatly constrained by the limited memory bandwidth and irregular data access patterns. In this work, we propose a data locality-aware design framework for FPGA-based SpMV acceleration. We first include the hardware constraints in sparse matrix compression at software level to regularize the memory allocation and accesses. Moreover, a distributed architecture composed of processing elements is developed to improve the computation parallelism. We implement the reconfigurable SpMV kernel on Convey HC-2ex and conduct the evaluation by using the University of Florida sparse matrix collection. The experiments demonstrate an average computational efficiency of 48.2\%, which is a lot better than those of CPU and GPU implementations. Our FPGA-based kernel has a comparable runtime as GPU, and achieves 2.1$\times$ reduction than CPU. Moreover, our design obtains substantial saving in energy consumption, say, 9.3$\times$ and 5.6$\times$ better than the implementations on CPU and GPU, respectively.},

In this paper, we extend the GraphLab framework to the substantially more challenging distributed setting while preserving strong data consistency guarantees. \\We develop graph based extensions to pipelined locking and data versioning to reduce network congestion and mitigate the effect of network latency. We also introduce fault tolerance to the GraphLab abstraction using the classic Chandy-Lamport snapshot algorithm and demonstrate how it can be easily implemented by exploiting the GraphLab abstraction itself. Finally, we evaluate our distributed implementation of the GraphLab abstraction on a large Amazon EC2 deployment and show 1-2 orders of magnitude performance gains over Hadoop-based implementations.},

Then an MPC for the chilling system operation is proposed to optimally store the thermal energy in the tank by using predictive knowledge of building loads and weather conditions. This brief addresses real-time implementation and feasibility issues of the MPC scheme by using a simplified hybrid model of the system, a periodic robust invariant set as terminal constraints, and a moving window blocking strategy. The controller is experimentally validated at the University of California, Merced. The experiments show a reduction in the central plant electricity cost and an improvement of its efficiency.},

The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. In this paper we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs that is expressive and easy to program.},

Multilevel incomplete LU factorization based preconditioners, which have been very successful for solving linear systems iteratively, require these triangular solves. Hence, the algorithms presented here can be seen as parallelizing the application of these preconditioners. The first algorithm solves the triangular matrix by block anti-diagonals. The drawback of this approach is that it can be difficult to choose an appropriate block structure. On the other hand, if a good block partition can be found, this algorithm can be quite effective. The second algorithm takes a hybrid approach by solving the triangular system by block columns and anti-diagonals. It is usually as effective as the first algorithm, but the block structure can be chosen in a nearly optimal manner. Although numerical results indicate that the speed-up can be fairly good, systems with matrices having a strong diagonal structure or narrow bandwidth cannot be solved effectively in parallel. Hence, for these matrices, the results are disappointing. On the other hand, the results are better for matrices having a more uniform distribution of non-zero elements. Although not discussed in this article, these algorithms can possibly be adapted for distributed memory architectures.},

The computations for the second derivative are combined with the computations for the centering direction. Computations in this approach do not require that primal and dual solutions be feasible. Expressions are given to compute all the higher-order derivatives of the trajectory of interest. The implementation ensures that a suitable potential function is reduced by a constant amount at each iteration. \\There are several salient features of this approach. An adaptive heuristic for estimating the centering parameter is given. The approach used to compute the step length is also adaptive. A new practical approach to compute the starting point is given. This approach treats primal and dual problems symmetrically. \\Computational results on a subset of problems available from netlib are given. On mutually tested problems the results show that the proposed method requires approximately 40 percent fewer iterations than the implementation proposed in Lustig, Marsten, and Shanno [Tech. Rep. TR J-89-11, Georgia Inst. of Technology, Atlanta, 1989]. It requires approximately 50 percent fewer iterations than the dual affine scaling method in Adler, Karmarkar, Resende, and Veiga [Math. Programming, 44 (1989), pp. 297-336], and 35 percent fewer iterations than the second-order dual affine scaling method in the same paper. The new approach for estimating the centering parameter and finding the step length and the starting point have contributed to the reduction in the number of iterations. However, the contribution due to the use of second derivative is most significant. \\On the tested problems, on the average the implementation shown was found to be approximately two times faster than OBl (version 02/90) described in Lustig, Marsten, and Shanno and 2.5 times faster than MINOS 5.3 described in Murtagh and Saunders [Tech.

  abstract     = {Breadth-first search (BFS) is a core primitive for graph traversal and a basis for many higher-level graph analysis algorithms. It is also representative of a class of parallel computations whose memory accesses and work distribution are both irregular and data-dependent. Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of GPU sparse graph traversal, but has tended to focus on asymptotically inefficient algorithms that perform poorly on graphs with non-trivial diameter. \\We present a BFS parallelization focused on fine-grained task management constructed from efficient prefix sum that achieves an asymptotically optimal $O(|V|+|E|)$ work complexity. Our implementation delivers excellent performance on diverse graphs, achieving traversal rates in excess of 3.3 billion and 8.3 billion traversed edges per second using single and quad-GPU configurations, respectively. This level of performance is several times faster than state-of-the-art implementations both CPU and GPU platforms.},

  abstract  = {The standard simplex method is a well-known optimization algorithm for solving linear programming models in the field of operational research. It is part of software that is often employed by businesses for solving scheduling or assignment problems. But their always increasing complexity and size drives the demand for more computational power.In the past few years, GPUs have gained a lot of popularity as they offer an opportunity to accelerate many algorithms. In this paper we present a mono and a multi-GPU implementation of the standard simplex method, which is based on CUDA. Measurements show that it outperforms the CLP solver provided the problem size is large enough. We also derive a performance model and establish its accurateness. To our knowledge, only the revised simplex method has so far been implemented on a GPU.},

Stochastic algorithms being random in their behavior are difficult to implement over GPU like architectures. In this paper we not only succeed in implementation of a stochastic algorithm over GPU but show considerable speedups over CPU implementations. The stochastic algorithm considered for this paper is an adaptive resolution approach to genetic algorithm (arGA), developed by the authors of this paper. The technique uses the entropy measure of each variable to adjust the intensity of the genetic search around promising individuals. Performance is further improved by hybridization with adaptive resolution local search (arLS) operator. In this paper, we describe the challenges and design choices involved in parallelization of this algorithm to solve complex MINLPs over a commodity GPU using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model. Results section shows several numerical tests and performance measurements obtained by running the algorithm over an nVidia Fermi GPU. We show that for difficult problems we can obtain a speedup of up to 20$\times$ with double precision and up to 42$\times$ with single precision.},

It is well known that atomics can be expensive, especially on massively parallel GPUs, and are often on the critical path of a program. In this paper, we present two high-level methods to eliminate atomics in irregular programs. The first method advocates synchronous processing using barriers. We illustrate how to exploit synchronous processing to avoid atomics even when the threads' memory accesses conflict with each other. The second method is based on exploiting algebraic properties of algorithms to elide atomics. Specifically, we focus on three key properties: monotonicity, idempotency and associativity, and show how each of them enables an atomic-free implementation. We illustrate the generality of the two methods by applying them to five irregular graph applications: breadth-first search, single-source shortest paths computation, Delaunay mesh refinement, pointer analysis and survey propagation, and show that both methods provide substantial speedup in each case on different GPUs.},

  abstract  = {Irregular algorithms are algorithms with complex main data structures such as directed and undirected graphs, trees, etc. A useful abstraction for many irregular algorithms is its operator formulation in which the algorithm is viewed as the iterated application of an operator to certain nodes, called active nodes, in the graph. Each operator application, called an activity, usually touches only a small part of the overall graph, so nonoverlapping activities can be performed in parallel. In topology-driven implementations, all nodes are assumed to be active so the operator is applied everywhere in the graph even if there is no work to do at some nodes. In contrast, in data-driven implementations the operator is applied only to nodes at which there might be work to do. Multicore implementations of irregular algorithms are usually data-driven because current multicores only support small numbers of threads and work-efficiency is important. Conversely, many irregular GPU implementations use a topology-driven approach because work inefficiency can be counterbalanced by the large number of GPU threads. In this paper, we study data-driven and topology-driven implementations of six important graph algorithms on GPUs. Our goal is to understand the tradeoffs between these implementations and how to optimize them. We find that data-driven versions are generally faster and scale better despite the cost of maintaining a worklist. However, topology-driven versions can be superior when certain algorithmic properties are exploited to optimize the implementation. These results led us to devise hybrid approaches that combine the two techniques and outperform both of them.},

Poor data locality, imbalanced parallel work and complex communication patterns make scaling these applications difficult. \\Grappa serves both as a C++ user library and as a foundation for higher level languages. Grappa tolerates delays to remote memory by multiplexing thousands of lightweight workers to each processor core, balances load via fine-grained distributed work-stealing, increases communication throughput by aggregating smaller data requests into large ones, and provides efficient synchronization and remote operations. We present a detailed description of the Grappa system and performance comparisons on several irregular benchmarks to hand-optimized MPI code and to the Cray XMT, a custom system used to target the real-time graph-analytics market. We find Grappa to be 9$\times$ faster than MPI on a random access microbenchmark, between 3.5$\times$ and 5.4$\times$ slower than MPI on applications, and between 2.6$\times$ faster and 4.4$\times$ slower than the XMT.},

Nevertheless, it is still extremely difficult to take advantage of the full potential of multicore processors. Moreover, when using third-party tools and/or in the presence of asymmetric sets of tasks, this problem would only aggravate. The EPIC framework was developed to ease the exploitation of task parallelism in irregular applications that use third-party tools and/or generate asymmetric sets of tasks. It is based on a software design and implements two algorithms that, together, allow, in a seamlessly way, the efficient exploitation of coarse-grained parallelism, fine-grained parallelism, and the combination of both of these types. Thus, it becomes possible to make a better and transparent usage of the performance potential of current multicore processors on shared-memory systems. In this paper, we present two refinements to the EPIC framework: one that refines the software design of the EPIC framework and another that refines the scheduling algorithm of the EPIC framework. Together, these refinements allow to cope with a special class of sets of tasks: sets of tasks where asymmetry is insignificant or can be neglected. Thus, these refinements broaden the applicability of the EPIC framework to a large class of irregular applications where task parallelism can be exploited. To assess the feasibility and the benefit of using this new version of the EPIC framework to exploit task parallelism, we used four real-world irregular applications three from phylogenetics and another from astrophysics and several input data sets with different characteristics. Our studies show groundbreaking results in terms of the achieved speedups and that scalability is not impaired, even when using third-party tools and/or in the presence of (a)symmetric sets of tasks.},

In this paper, we argue that existing DSLs can be implemented on top of a general-purpose infrastructure that (i) supports very fine-grain tasks, (ii) implements autonomous, speculative execution of these tasks, and (iii) allows application-specific control of task scheduling policies. To support this claim, we describe such an implementation called the Galois system. \\We demonstrate the capabilities of this infrastructure in three ways. First, we implement more sophisticated algorithms for some of the graph analytics problems tackled by previous DSLs and show that end-to-end performance can be improved by orders of magnitude even on power-law graphs, thanks to the better algorithms facilitated by a more general programming model. Second, we show that, even when an algorithm can be expressed in existing DSLs, the implementation of that algorithm in the more general system can be orders of magnitude faster when the input graphs are road networks and similar graphs with high diameter, thanks to more sophisticated scheduling. Third, we implement the APIs of three existing graph DSLs on top of the common infrastructure in a few hundred lines of code and show that even for power-law graphs, the performance of the resulting implementations often exceeds that of the original DSL systems, thanks to the lightweight infrastructure.},

For this method, which we refer to as flexible CG, we develop a theoretical analysis that shows that the convergence rate is essentially independent of the variations in the preconditioner as long as the latter are kept sufficiently small. We further discuss the real convergence rate on the basis of some heuristic arguments supported by numerical experiments. Depending on the eigenvalue distribution corresponding to the fixed reference preconditioner, several situations have to be distinguished. In some cases, the convergence is as fast with truncated versions of the algorithm or even with the standard CG method, whereas quite large variations are allowed without too much penalty. In other cases, the flexible variant effectively outperforms the standard method, while the need for truncation limits the size of the variations that can be reasonably allowed.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the mapping of algorithms encountered when solving dense linear systems and linear least-squares problems to a custom Linear Algebra Processor. Specifically, the focus is on Cholesky, LU (with partial pivoting), and QR factorizations and their blocked algorithms. As part of the study, we expose the benefits of redesigning floating point units and their surrounding data-paths to support these complicated operations. We show how adding moderate complexity to the architecture greatly alleviates complexities in the algorithm. We study design tradeoffs and the effectiveness of architectural modifications to demonstrate that we can improve power and performance efficiency to a level that can otherwise only be expected of full-custom ASIC designs. A feasibility study of inner kernels is extended to blocked level and shows that, at block level, the Linear Algebra Core (LAC) can achieve high efficiencies with up to 45 GFLOPS/W for both Cholesky and LU factorization, and over 35 GFLOPS/W for QR factorization. While maintaining such efficiencies, our extensions to the MAC units can achieve up to 10, 12, and 20 percent speedup for the blocked algorithms of Cholesky, LU, and QR factorization, respectively.},

  abstract     = {For more than thirty years, the parallel programming community has used the dependence graph as the main abstraction for reasoning about and exploiting parallelism in "regular" algorithms that use dense arrays, such as finite-differences and FFTs. In this paper, we argue that the dependence graph is not a suitable abstraction for algorithms in new application areas like machine learning and network analysis in which the key data structures are "irregular" data structures like graphs, trees, and sets. \\To address the need for better abstractions, we introduce a data-centric formulation of algorithms called the operator formulation in which an algorithm is expressed in terms of its action on data structures. This formulation is the basis for a structural analysis of algorithms that we call tao-analysis. Tao-analysis can be viewed as an abstraction of algorithms that distills out algorithmic properties important for parallelization. It reveals that a generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism is ubiquitous in algorithms, and that, depending on the tao-structure of the algorithm, this parallelism may be exploited by compile-time, inspector-executor or optimistic parallelization, thereby unifying these seemingly unrelated parallelization techniques. Regular algorithms emerge as a special case of irregular algorithms, and many application-specific optimization techniques can be generalized to a broader context. \\These results suggest that the operator formulation and tao-analysis of algorithms can be the foundation of a systematic approach to parallel programming.},

Automated planning allows us to use constraints to declaratively encode program transformations such as scheduling, implementation selection, and insertion of synchronization. Each plan emitted by the planner satisfies all constraints simultaneously, and corresponds to a composition of these transformations. In this way, we obtain an integrated compilation approach for a very challenging problem domain. We have used this system to synthesize parallel programs for four graph problems: triangle counting, maximal independent set computation, preflow-push maxflow, and connected components. Experiments on a variety of inputs show that the synthesized implementations perform competitively with hand-written, highly-tuned code.},

  abstract  = {Sparse matrix-vector multiplication is an integral part of many scientific algorithms. Several studies have shown that it is a bandwidth-limited operation on current hardware. On cache-based architectures the main factors that influence performance are spatial locality in accessing the matrix, and temporal locality in re-using the elements of the vector. This paper discusses efficient implementations of sparse matrix-vector multiplication on NVIDIA's Fermi architecture, the first to introduce conventional L1 caches to GPUs. We focus on the compressed sparse row (CSR) format for developing general purpose code. We present a parametrised algorithm, show the effects of parameter tuning on performance and introduce a method for determining the nearoptimal set of parameters that incurs virtually no overhead. On a set of sparse matrices from the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection we show an average speed-up of 2.1 times over NVIDIA's CUSPARSE 4.0 library in single precision and 1.4 times in double precision. Many algorithms require repeated evaluation of sparse matrix-vector products with the same matrix, so we introduce a dynamic run-time auto-tuning system which improves performance by 10-15\% in seven iterations. The CSR format is compared to alternative ELLPACK and HYB formats and the cost of conversion is assessed using CUSPARSE. Sparse matrix-vector multiplication performance is also analysed when solving a finite element problem with the conjugate gradient method. We show how problemspecific knowledge can be used to improve performance by up to a factor of two.},

The strong data-dependency determines that parallel sparse LU factorization runs efficiently on shared-memory computing devices. But the number of CPU cores sharing the same memory is often limited. The state of the art Graphic Processing Units (GPU) naturally have numerous cores sharing the device memory, and provide a possible solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose a GPU-based sparse LU solver for circuit simulation. We optimize the work partitioning, the number of active thread groups, and the memory access pattern, based on GPU architecture. On matrices whose factorization involves many floating-point operations, our GPU-based sparse LU factorization achieves 7.90$\times$ speedup over 1-core CPU and 1.49$\times$ speedup over 8-core CPU. We also analyze the scalability of parallel sparse LU factorization and investigate the specifications on CPUs and GPUs that most influence the performance.},

At the same time, computational scientists face the question of which programming model to use to obtain their scientific results. We present the linear algebra library ViennaCL, which is built on top of all three programming models, thus enabling computational scientists to interface to a single library, yet obtain high performance for all three hardware types. Since the respective compute back end can be selected at runtime, one can seamlessly switch between different hardware types without the need for error-prone and time-consuming recompilation steps. We present new benchmark results for sparse linear algebra operations in ViennaCL, complementing results for the dense linear algebra operations in ViennaCL reported in earlier work. Comparisons with vendor libraries show that ViennaCL provides better overall performance for sparse matrix-vector and sparse matrix-matrix products. Additional benchmark results for pipelined iterative solvers with kernel fusion and preconditioners identify the respective sweet spots for CPUs, Xeon Phis, and GPUs.}

  abstract  = {Program optimization for highly-parallel systems has historically been considered an art, with experts doing much of the performance tuning by hand. With the introduction of inexpensive, single-chip, massively parallel platforms, more developers will be creating highly-parallel applications for these platforms, who lack the substantial experience and knowledge needed to maximize their performance. This creates a need for more structured optimization methods with means to estimate their performance effects. Furthermore these methods need to be understandable by most programmers. This paper shows the complexity involved in optimizing applications for one such system and one relatively simple methodology for reducing the workload involved in the optimization process. \\This work is based on one such highly-parallel system, the GeForce 8800 GTX using CUDA. Its flexible allocation of resources to threads allows it to extract performance from a range of applications with varying resource requirements, but places new demands on developers who seek to maximize an application's performance. We show how optimizations interact with the architecture in complex ways, initially prompting an inspection of the entire configuration space to find the optimal configuration. Even for a seemingly simple application such as matrix multiplication, the optimal configuration can be unexpected. We then present metrics derived from static code that capture the first-order factors of performance. We demonstrate how these metrics can be used to prune many optimization configurations, down to those that lie on a Pareto-optimal curve. This reduces the optimization space by as much as 98\% and still finds the optimal configuration for each of the studied applications.},

Similar issues with the MapReduce framework have led to widely-used languages such as Pig Latin and Hive, which introduce higher-level primitives. We take an analogous approach for graph processing: we propose HelP, a set of high-level primitives that capture commonly appearing operations in large-scale graph computations. Using our primitives we have implemented a large suite of algorithms, some of which we previously implemented with the APIs of existing systems. Our experience has been that implementing algorithms using our primitives is more intuitive and much faster than using the APIs of existing distributed systems.

Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided.

By making use of them, we confirmed that 79.5\% of the cycle times are reduced, compared with straightforward sequential processing. The operating frequency is 67 MHz, although a core 2 duo PC requires 3.16 GHz in processing the same size problem. The power consumption of the MIQP solver is 4.2 W.},

For a given fixed sampling interval, the effects of computing time delay are classified into the delay and loss problems. The delay problem occurs when the computing time delay is nonzero but smaller than the sampling interval, while the loss problem occurs when the computing time delay is greater than, or equal to, the sampling interval, i.e., loss of the control output. These two problems are analyzed as a means of evaluating real-time control systems. First, a generic analysis of the effects of computing time delay is presented along with necessary conditions for system stability. Then, we present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the computing time delay effects on a robot control system, deriving upper bounds of the computing time delay with respect to system stability and system performance.},

  abstract  = {There has been significant recent interest in parallel frameworks for processing graphs due to their applicability in studying social networks, the Web graph, networks in biology, and unstructured meshes in scientific simulation. Due to the desire to process large graphs, these systems have emphasized the ability to run on distributed memory machines. Today, however, a single multicore server can support more than a terabyte of memory, which can fit graphs with tens or even hundreds of billions of edges. Furthermore, for graph algorithms, shared-memory multicores are generally significantly more efficient on a per core, per dollar, and per joule basis than distributed memory systems, and shared-memory algorithms tend to be simpler than their distributed counterparts. \\In this paper, we present a lightweight graph processing framework that is specific for shared-memory parallel/multicore machines, which makes graph traversal algorithms easy to write. The framework has two very simple routines, one for mapping over edges and one for mapping over vertices. Our routines can be applied to any subset of the vertices, which makes the framework useful for many graph traversal algorithms that operate on subsets of the vertices. Based on recent ideas used in a very fast algorithm for breadth-first search (BFS), our routines automatically adapt to the density of vertex sets. We implement several algorithms in this framework, including BFS, graph radii estimation, graph connectivity, betweenness centrality, PageRank and single-source shortest paths. Our algorithms expressed using this framework are very simple and concise, and perform almost as well as highly optimized code. Furthermore, they get good speedups on a 40-core machine and are significantly more efficient than previously reported results using graph frameworks on machines with many more cores.},

In particular, for sparse matrix triangular solves the traditional compressed sparse matrix format is poor, and minor adjustments to the data structure can increase the processor utilization dramatically. Such adjustments involve storing the L and U factors separately and storing the U rows backwards so that they are accessed in a simple streaming fashion during the triangular solves. Changes to the PETSc libraries to use this modified storage format resulted in over twice the floating-point rate for some matrices. This improvement can be accounted for by a decrease in the cache misses and TLB (transaction lookaside buffer) misses in the modified code.},

  abstract    = {The factors limiting the performance of computer software periodically undergo sudden shifts, resulting from technological progress, and these shifts can have profound implications for the design of high performance codes. At the present time, the speed with which hardware can execute a single stream of instructions has reached a plateau. It is now the number of instruction streams that may be executed concurrently which underpins estimates of compute power, and with this change, a critical limitation on the performance of software has come to be the degree to which it can be parallelised. The research in this thesis is concerned with the means by which codes for linear programming may be adapted to this new hardware. For the most part, it is codes implementing the simplex method which will be discussed, though these have typically lower performance for single solves than those implementing interior point methods. However, the ability of the simplex method to rapidly re-solve a problem makes it at present indispensable as a subroutine for mixed integer programming. The long history of the simplex method as a practical technique, with applications in many industries and government, has led to such codes reaching a great level of sophistication. It would be unexpected in a research project such as this one to match the performance of top commercial codes with many years of development behind them. The simplex codes described in this thesis are, however, able to solve real problems of small to moderate size, rather than being confined to random or otherwise artificially generated instances. The remainder of this thesis is structured as follows. The rest of this chapter gives a brief overview of the essential elements of modern parallel hardware and of the linear programming problem. Both the simplex method and interior point methods are discussed, along with some of the key algorithmic enhancements required for such systems to solve real-world problems. Some background on the parallelisation of both types of code is given. The next chapter describes two standard simplex codes designed to exploit the current generation of hardware. i6 is a parallel standard simplex solver capable of being applied to a range of real problems, and showing exceptional performance for dense, square programs. i8 is also a parallel, standard simplex solver, but now implemented for graphics processing units (GPUs).},

They are not directly amenable for algorithms which have irregular data access patterns such as list ranking, and finding the connected components of a graph, and the like. In this work, we present a GPU-optimized implementation for finding the connected components of a given graph. Our implementation tries to minimize the impact of irregularity, both at the data level and functional level. Our implementation achieves a speed up of 9 to 12 times over the best sequential CPU implementation. For instance, our implementation finds connected components of a graph of 10 million nodes and 60 million edges in about 500 milliseconds on a GPU, given a random edge list. We also draw interesting observations on why PRAM algorithms, such as the Shiloach-Vishkin algorithm may not be a good fit for the GPU and how they should be modified.},

Typically, real problems involve several hundreds of variables, and are subject to as many constraints. Several methods have been developed trying to reduce the theoretical time complexity. Nevertheless, when problems exceed reasonable sizes they end up being very computationally intensive. Heterogeneous systems composed by coupling commodity CPUs and GPUs are becoming relatively cheap, highly performing systems. Recent developments of GPGPU technologies give even more powerful control over them. In this paper, we show how we use a revised simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems originally described by Dantzig for both our CPU and GPU implementations. Previously, this approach has showed not to scale beyond around 200 variables. However, by taking advantage of modern libraries such as ATLAS for matrix-matrix multiplication, and the NVIDIA CUDA programming library on recent GPUs, we show that we can scale to problem sizes up to at least 2000 variables in our experiments for both architectures. On the GPU, we also achieve an appreciable precision on large problems with thousands of variables and constraints while achieving between 2$\times$ and 2.5$\times$ speed-ups over the serial ATLAS-based CPU version. With further tuning of both the algorithm and its implementations, even better results should be achievable for both the CPU and GPU versions.},

Currently, a key challenge is adapting scientific applications to such systems when the underlying computations are sparse, such as sparse linear solvers for the simulation of partial differential equation models using semi-implicit methods. Now, a key bottleneck is sparse triangular solution for solvers such as preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG). We show that sparse triangular solution can be effectively mapped to GPUs by extracting very large degrees of fine-grained parallelism using graph coloring. We develop simple performance models to predict these effects at intersection of the data and hardware attributes and we evaluate our scheme on a Nvidia Tesla M2090 GPU relative to the level set scheme developed at NVIDIA. Our results indicate that our approach significantly enhances the available fine-grained parallelism to speed-up PCG iteration time compared to the NVIDIA scheme, by a factor with a geometric mean of 5.41 on a single GPU, with speedups as high as 63 in some cases.},

One of the main challenges of SpMV is its memory-boundedness. Although compression has been proposed previously to improve SpMV performance on CPUs, its use has not been demonstrated on the GPU because of the serial nature of many compression and decompression schemes. In this paper, we introduce a family of bit-representation-optimized (BRO) compression schemes for representing sparse matrices on GPUs. The proposed schemes, BRO-ELL, BRO-COO, and BRO-HYB, perform compression on index data and help to speed up SpMV on GPUs through reduction of memory traffic. Furthermore, we formulate a BRO-aware matrix reordering scheme as a data clustering problem and use it to increase compression ratios. With the proposed schemes, experiments show that average speedups of 1.5$\times$ compared to ELLPACK and HYB can be achieved for SpMV on GPUs.},

The behavior on cache of one of the most frequent primitives, SpMxV sparse matrix vector multiply, is analyzed. A model of its references is built, and performance bottlenecks of SpMxV are analyzed using the model and simulations. The main parameters are identified and their role is explained and quantified. This analysis is then used to discuss optimizations of SpMxV. A blocking technique which takes into account the specifics of sparse codes is proposed.},

  abstract  = {The OpenCL standard allows targeting a large variety of CPU, GPU and accelerator architectures using a single unified programming interface and language. While the standard guarantees portability of functionality for complying applications and platforms, performance portability on such a diverse set of hardware is limited. Devices may vary significantly in memory architecture as well as type, number and complexity of computational units. To characterize and compare the OpenCL performance of existing and future devices we propose a suite of microbenchmarks, uCLbench. \\We present measurements for eight hardware architectures four GPUs, three CPUs and one accelerator and illustrate how the results accurately reflect unique characteristics of the respective platform. In addition to measuring quantities traditionally benchmarked on CPUs like arithmetic throughput or the bandwidth and latency of various address spaces, the suite also includes code designed to determine parameters unique to OpenCL like the dynamic branching penalties prevalent on GPUs. We demonstrate how our results can be used to guide algorithm design and optimization for any given platform on an example kernel that represents the key computation of a linear multigrid solver. Guided manual optimization of this kernel results in an average improvement of 61\% across the eight platforms tested.},

Both for direct methods and for many iterative preconditioners, it is used to solve the system or improve an approximate solution, often across many iterations. Solving triangular systems is notoriously resistant to parallelism, however, and existing parallel linear algebra packages appear to be ineffective in exploiting significant parallelism for this problem. \\We develop a novel parallel algorithm based on various heuristics that adapt to the structure of the matrix and extract parallelism that is unexploited by conventional methods. By analyzing and reordering operations, our algorithm can often extract parallelism even for cases where most of the nonzero matrix entries are near the diagonal. Our main parallelism strategies are: (1) identify independent rows, (2) send data earlier to achieve greater overlap, and (3) process dense off-diagonal regions in parallel. We describe the implementation of our algorithm in Charm++ and MPI and present promising experimental results on up to 512 cores of BlueGene/P, using numerous sparse matrices from real applications.},

  abstract  = {Hundreds of cores per chip and support for fine-grain multithreading have made GPUs a central player in today's HPC world. For many applications, however, achieving a high fraction of peak on current GPUs, still requires significant programmer effort. A key consideration for optimizing GPU code is determining a suitable amount of work to be performed by each thread. Thread granularity not only has a direct impact on occupancy but can also influence data locality at the register and shared-memory levels. This paper describes a software framework to analyze dependencies in parallel GPU threads and perform source-level restructuring to obtain GPU kernels with varying thread granularity. The framework supports specification of coarsening factors through source-code annotation and also implements a heuristic based on estimated register pressure that automatically recommends coarsening factors for improved memory performance. We present preliminary experimental results on a select set of CUDA kernels. The results show that the proposed strategy is generally able to select profitable coarsening factors. More importantly, the results demonstrate a clear need for automatic control of thread granularity at the software level for achieving higher performance.},

In this paper, we present a novel adaptive partitioning strategy specially designed for irregular applications running on heterogeneous CPU-GPU chips. The main novelty of this work is that the size of the workload assigned to the GPU and CPU adapts dynamically to maximize the GPU and CPU utilization while balancing the workload among the devices.

"Gunrock," our high-level bulk-synchronous graph-processing system targeting the GPU, takes a new approach to abstracting GPU graph analytics: rather than designing an abstraction around computation, Gunrock instead implements a novel data-centric abstraction centered on operations on a vertex or edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge. We evaluate Gunrock on five graph primitives (BFS, BC, SSSP, CC, and PageRank) and show that Gunrock has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over Boost and PowerGraph, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives, and better performance than any other GPU high-level graph library.},

By constructing the LGP within this framework, we effectively produce an LGP game for PC and XBox 360 that displays results as they evolve. We use the GPU of each device to parallelize fitness evaluation and the mutation operator of the LGP algorithm, thus providing a general LGP implementation suitable for parallel computation on heterogeneous devices. While parallel GP implementations on PCs are now common, both the implementation of GP on a video game console using GPU and the construction of a GP around a framework for heterogeneous devices are novel contributions. The objective of this work is to describe how to implement the parallel execution of LGP in order to use the underlying hardware (especially GPU) on the different platforms while still maintaining loyalty to the general methodology of the LGP algorithm built for the common framework. We discuss the implementation of texture-based data structures and the sequential and parallel algorithms built for their use on both CPU and GPU. Following the description of the general algorithm, the particular tailoring of the implementations for each hardware platform is described. Sequential (CPU) and parallel (GPU-based) algorithm performance is compared on both PC and video game platforms using the metrics of GP operations per second, actual time elapsed, speedup of parallel over sequential implementation, and percentage of execution time used by the GPU versus CPU.},

The GeneRank algorithm amounts to solving an unsymmetric linear system. However, when the matrix in question is very large, the GeneRank algorithm is inefficient and even can be infeasible. On the other hand, the adjacency matrix is symmetric in the GeneRank model, while the original GeneRank algorithm fails to exploit the symmetric structure of the problem in question. In this paper, we discover that the GeneRank problem can be rewritten as a symmetric positive definite linear system, and propose a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm to solve it.

  abstract  = {As we increase the number of cores on a processor die, the on-chip cache hierarchies that support these cores are getting larger, deeper, and more complex. As a result, non-uniform memory access effects are now prevalent even on a single chip. To reduce execution time and energy consumption, data access locality should be exploited. This is especially important for task-based programming systems, where a scheduler decides when and where on the chip the code segments, i.e., tasks, should execute. Capturing locality for structured task parallelism has been done effectively, but the more difficult case, unstructured parallelism, remains largely unsolved - little quantitative analysis exists to demonstrate the potential of locality-aware scheduling, and to guide future scheduler implementations in the most fruitful direction. \\ This paper quantifies the potential of locality-aware scheduling for unstructured parallelism on three different many-core processors. Our simulation results of 32-core systems show that locality-aware scheduling can bring up to 2.39$\times$ speedup over a randomized schedule, and 2.05$\times$ speedup over a state-of-the-art baseline scheduling scheme. At the same time, a locality-aware schedule reduces average energy consumption by 55\% and 47\%, relative to the random and the baseline schedule, respectively. In addition, our 1024-core simulation results project that these benefits will only increase: Compared to 32-core executions, we see up to 1.83$\times$ additional locality benefits. To capture such potentials in a practical setting, we also perform a detailed scheduler design space exploration to quantify the impact of different scheduling decisions. We also highlight the importance of locality-aware stealing, and demonstrate that a stealing scheme can exploit significant locality while performing load balancing. Over randomized stealing, our proposed scheme shows up to 2.0$\times$ speedup for stolen tasks.},

  abstract  = {In POPL 2002, Petrank and Rawitz showed a universal result---finding optimal data placement is not only NP-hard but also impossible to approximate within a constant factor if P $\neq$ NP. Here we study a recently published concept called reference affinity, which characterizes a group of data that are always accessed together in computation. On the theoretical side, we give the complexity for finding reference affinity in program traces, using a novel reduction that converts the notion of distance into satisfiability. We also prove that reference affinity automatically captures the hierarchical locality in divide-and-conquer computations including matrix solvers and N-body simulation. The proof establishes formal links between computation patterns in time and locality relations in space.On the practical side, we show that efficient heuristics exist. In particular, we present a sampling method and show that it is more effective than the previously published technique, especially for data that are often but not always accessed together. We show the effect on generated and real traces. These theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that effective data placement is still attainable in general-purpose programs because common (albeit not all) locality patterns can be precisely modeled and efficiently analyzed.},

It is one of the original and perhaps most studied targets for FPGA acceleration. Despite this, GPUs, which have only recently gained both general-purpose programmability and native support for double precision floating-point arithmetic, are viewed by some as a more effective platform for SpMV and similar linear algebra computations. In this paper, we present an analysis comparing an existing GPU SpMV implementation to our own, novel FPGA implementation. In this analysis, we describe the challenges faced by any SpMV implementation, the unique approaches to these challenges taken by both FPGA and GPU implementations, and their relative performance for SpMV.},

The developed HEMS is shown to optimize the utilization of local renewables while minimizing energy waste between AC and DC conversions and between storage charging and discharging. Previous studies on HEMS have not considered the impact of load types. In this study, the performance of the proposed HEMS is demonstrated on different smart homes with and without electric heating. A comparative study is carried out to investigate battery behavior, characteristics of AC and DC conversion, and benefits that customers receive. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to discuss the effects from varied energy storage capacities, AC/DC conversion efficiencies, and PV output. The results show that cost reduction in energy bills can be greatly impacted by load profiles, and customers with electric heating load coupled with sufficiently large energy storage would receive the most reduction in their energy bills.}

Recently, the graphics processing unit (GPU) has been adopted to accelerate various graph processing algorithms such as BFS and shortest paths. However, it is difficult to write correct and efficient GPU programs and even more difficult for graph processing due to the irregularities of graph structures. To simplify graph processing on GPUs, we propose a programming framework called Medusa which enables developers to leverage the capabilities of GPUs by writing sequential C/C++ code. Medusa offers a small set of user-defined APIs and embraces a runtime system to automatically execute those APIs in parallel on the GPU. We develop a series of graph-centric optimizations based on the architecture features of GPUs for efficiency. Additionally, Medusa is extended to execute on multiple GPUs within a machine. Our experiments show that 1) Medusa greatly simplifies implementation of GPGPU programs for graph processing, with many fewer lines of source code written by developers and 2) the optimization techniques significantly improve the performance of the runtime system, making its performance comparable with or better than manually tuned GPU graph operations.},

In this paper, we propose CSR5 (Compressed Sparse Row 5), a new storage format, which offers high-throughput SpMV on various platforms including CPUs, GPUs and Xeon Phi. First, the CSR5 format is insensitive to the sparsity structure of the input matrix. Thus the single format can support an SpMV algorithm that is efficient both for regular matrices and for irregular matrices. Furthermore, we show that the overhead of the format conversion from the CSR to the CSR5 can be as low as the cost of a few SpMV operations.\\We compare the CSR5-based SpMV algorithm with 11 state-of-the-art formats and algorithms on four mainstream processors using 14 regular and 10 irregular matrices as a benchmark suite. For the 14 regular matrices in the suite, we achieve comparable or better performance over the previous work. For the 10 irregular matrices, the CSR5 obtains average performance improvement of 17.6\%, 28.5\%, 173.0\% and 293.3\% (up to 213.3\%, 153.6\%, 405.1\% and 943.3\%) over the best existing work on dual-socket Intel CPUs, an nVidia GPU, an AMD GPU and an Intel Xeon Phi, respectively. For real-world applications such as a solver with only tens of iterations, the CSR5 format can be more practical because of its low-overhead for format conversion.},

LSMR is based on the Golub--Kahan bidiagonalization process. It is analytically equivalent to the MINRES method applied to the normal equation $A^T\! Ax = A^T\! b$, so that the quantities $\|A^T\! r_k\|$ are monotonically decreasing (where $r_k = b - Ax_k$ is the residual for the current iterate $x_k$). We observe in practice that $\|r_k\|$ also decreases monotonically, so that compared to LSQR (for which only $\|r_k\|$ is monotonic) it is safer to terminate LSMR early. We also report some experiments with reorthogonalization.}

  abstract  = {Mixed integer programming (MIP) has become one of the most important techniques in Operations Research and Discrete Optimization. SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) is currently one of the fastest non-commercial MIP solvers. It is based on the branch-and-bound procedure in which the problem is recursively split into smaller subproblems, thereby creating a so-called branching tree. We present ParaSCIP, an extension of SCIP, which realizes a parallelization on a distributed memory computing environment. ParaSCIP uses SCIP solvers as independently running processes to solve subproblems (nodes of the branching tree) locally. This makes the parallelization development independent of the SCIP development. Thus, ParaSCIP directly profits from any algorithmic progress in future versions of SCIP. Using a first implementation of ParaSCIP, we were able to solve two previously unsolved instances from MIPLIB2003, a standard test set library for MIP solvers. For these computations, we used up to 2048 cores of the HLRN~II supercomputer.}

  abstract    = {Recently, parallel computing environments have become significantly popular. In order to obtain the benefit of using parallel computing environments, we have to deploy our programs for these effectively. This paper focuses on a parallelization of SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs), which is a MIP solver and constraint integer programming framework available in source code. There is a parallel extension of SCIP named ParaSCIP, which parallelizes SCIP on massively parallel distributed memory computing environments. This paper describes FiberSCIP, which is yet another parallel extension of SCIP to utilize multi-threaded parallel computation on shared memory computing environments, and has the following contributions: First, the basic concept of having two parallel extensions and the relationship between them and the parallelization framework provided by UG (Ubiquity Generator) is presented, including an implementation of deterministic parallelization. Second, the difficulties to achieve a good performance that utilizes all resources on an actual computing environment and the difficulties of performance evaluation of the parallel solvers are discussed. Third, a way to evaluate the performance of new algorithms and parameter settings of the parallel extensions is presented. Finally, current performance of FiberSCIP for solving mixed-integer linear programs (MIPs) and mixed-integer non-linear programs (MINLPs) in parallel is demonstrated.},

In contrast to the uniform regularity of dense linear algebra, sparse operations encounter a broad spectrum of matrices ranging from the regular to the highly irregular. Harnessing the tremendous potential of throughput-oriented processors for sparse operations requires that we expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and impose sufficient regularity on execution paths and memory access patterns. We explore SpMV methods that are well-suited to throughput-oriented architectures like the GPU and which exploit several common sparsity classes. The techniques we propose are efficient, successfully utilizing large percentages of peak bandwidth. Furthermore, they deliver excellent total throughput, averaging 16 GFLOP/s and 10 GFLOP/s in double precision for structured grid and unstructured mesh matrices, respectively, on a GeForce GTX 285. This is roughly 2.8 times the throughput previously achieved on Cell BE and more than 10 times that of a quad-core Intel Clovertown system.},

While k iterations of the iterative solver can be unrolled to provide O(k) reduction in communication cost, the extent of this unrolling depends on the underlying architecture, its memory model, and the growth in redundant computation. This paper presents a systematic procedure to select this algorithmic parameter k, which provides communication-computation tradeoff on hardware accelerators like FPGA and GPU. We provide predictive models to understand this tradeoff and show how careful selection of k can lead to performance improvement that otherwise demands significant increase in memory bandwidth. On an Nvidia C2050 GPU, we demonstrate a 1.9$\times$-42.6$\times$ speedup over standard iterative solvers for a range of benchmarks and that this speedup is limited by the growth in redundant computation. In contrast, for FPGAs, we present an architecture-aware algorithm that limits off-chip communication but allows communication between the processing cores. This reduces redundant computation and allows large k and hence higher speedups. Our approach for FPGA provides a 0.3$\times$-4.4$\times$ speedup over same-generation GPU devices where k is picked carefully for both architectures for a range of benchmark.},

CUDA even provides a BLAS implementation, but only for dense matrices (CuBLAS). Other existing linear solvers for the GPU are also limited by their internal matrix representation. This paper describes how to combine recent GPU programming techniques and new GPU dedicated APIs with high performance computing strategies (namely block compressed row storage (BCRS), register blocking and vectorization), to implement a sparse general-purpose linear solver. Our implementation of the Jacobi-preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm outperforms by up to a factor of 6.0$\times$ leading-edge CPU counterparts, making it attractive for applications which are content with single precision.}

To accelerate the solution of such equations, two types of approaches have been used: on GPUs, concurrency has been prioritised to the disadvantage of data locality, while on multi-core CPUs, data locality has been prioritised to the disadvantage of concurrency. In this paper, we discuss the interaction between data locality and concurrency in the solution of STLs on GPUs, and we present a new algorithm that balances both. We demonstrate empirically that, subject to there being enough concurrency available in the input matrix, our algorithm outperforms Nvidia's concurrency-prioritising CUSPARSE algorithm for GPUs. Experimental results show a maximum speedup of 5.8-fold. Our solution algorithm, which we have implemented in OpenCL, requires a pre-processing phase that partitions the graph associated with the input matrix into sub-graphs, whose data can be stored in low-latency local memories. This preliminary analysis phase is expensive, but because it depends only on the input matrix, its cost can be amortised when solving for many different right-hand sides.},

In particular, a result of the flexibility of the new variant is that any iterative method can be used as a preconditioner. For example, the standard GMRES algorithm itself can be used as a preconditioner, as can CGNR (or CGNE), the conjugate gradient method applied to the normal equations. However, the more appealing utilization of the method is in conjunction with relaxation techniques, possibly multilevel techniques. The possibility of changing preconditioners may be exploited to develop efficient iterative methods and to enhance robustness. A few numerical experiments are reported to illustrate this fact.}

On the basis of  several numerical experiments, it was conjectured by Serra-Capizzano that a completely analogous expansion also holds for the eigenvalues of the preconditioned Toeplitz matrix $T_n(u)^{-1}T_n(v)$, provided $f = v/u$ is monotone and further conditions on $u$ and $v$ are satisfied. Based on this expansion, we here propose and analyze an interpolation--extrapolation algorithm for computing the eigenvalues of $T_n(u)^{-1}T_n(v)$. The algorithm is suited for parallel implementation and it may be called “matrix-less” as it does not need to store the entries of the matrix. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm through numerical experiments and we also present its generalization to the case where $f = v/u$ is non-monotone.},

  abstract     = {Predictive control of hybrid systems is currently considered prohibitive using embedded computing platforms. To overcome this limitation for mixed logical dynamical systems of small to medium size, we propose to use (1) a standard branch-and-bound approach combined with a fast embedded interior point solver, (2) pre-processing heuristics, run once and offline, to significantly reduce the number of subproblems to be solved, and (3) relaxations of the original MPC problem that allow a trade off between computation time and closed-loop performance. A problem-specific ANSI C implementation of the proposed method can be automatically generated, and has a fixed memory footprint and a code size that is insignificantly larger than that of the subproblem solver. Two extensive numerical studies are presented, where problems with up to 60 binary variables are solved in less than 0.2 s with a performance deterioration of below 2\% when compared to an optimal MPC scheme.},

  abstract     = {A recent approach for solving sparse triangular systems of equations on massively parallel computers employs a factorization of the triangular coefficient matrix to obtain a representation of its inverse in product form. The number of general communication steps required by this approach is proportional to the number of factors in the factorization. The triangular matrix can be symmetrically permuted to minimize the number of factors over suitable classes of permutations, and thereby the complexity of the parallel algorithm can be minimized. Algorithms for minimizing the number of factors over several classes of permutations have been considered in earlier work. Let $F = L + L^T$ denote the symmetric filled matrix corresponding to a Cholesky factor L, and let $G_F$ denote the adjacency graph of F. We consider the problem of minimizing the number of factors over all permutations which preserve the structure of $G_F$. The graph model of this problem is to partition the vertices $G_F$ into the fewest transitively closed subgraphs over all perfect elimination orderings while satisfying a certain precedence relationship. The solution to this chordal-graph partitioning problem can be described by a greedy scheme which eliminates a largest permissible subgraph at each step. Further, the subgraph eliminated at each step can be characterized in terms of lengths of chordless paths in the current elimination graph. This solution relies on several results concerning transitive perfect elimination orderings introduced in this paper. We describe a partitioning algorithm with $O(|V| + |E|)$ time and space complexity.}

As its name indicates, the package exploits spectrum slicing, a strategy that consists of dividing the spectrum into a number of subintervals and extracting eigenpairs from each subinterval independently. In order to enable such a strategy, the methods implemented in EVSL rely on a quick calculation of the spectral density of a given matrix, or a matrix pair. What distinguishes EVSL from other currently available packages is that EVSL relies entirely on filtering techniques. Polynomial and rational filtering are both implemented and are coupled with Krylov subspace methods and the subspace iteration algorithm. On the implementation side, the package offers interfaces for various scenarios including matrix-free modes, whereby the user can supply his/her own functions to perform matrix-vector operations or to solve sparse linear systems. The paper describes the algorithms in EVSL, provides details on their implementations, and discusses performance issues for the various methods.},

We analyzed the speedup and the parallel efficiency for the proposed implementation relative to the standard Simplex algorithm using a shared-memory system with 64 processing cores. The experiments were performed for several different problems, with up to 8192 variables and constraints, in their primal and dual formulations. The results show that the performance is mostly much better when we use the formulation with more variables than inequality constraints. Also, they show that the parallelization strategies applied to avoid bottlenecks caused the implementation to scale well with the problem size and the core count up to a certain limit of problem size. Further analysis showed that this was an effect of resource limitation. Even though, our implementation was able to reach speedups in the order of 19$\times$.},

The minimization is initialized from a cut provided by a state-of-the-art multilevel recursive bisection algorithm, and then a continuation approach reduces the p-norm from a 2-norm towards a 1-norm, employing for each value of p a feasibility-preserving steepest-descent method that converges on the p-Laplacian eigenvector. A filter favors iterates advancing towards minimum edgecut and partition load imbalance. The complexity of the suggested approach is linear in graph edges. The simplicity of the steepest-descent algorithm renders the overall approach highly scalable and efficient in parallel distributed architectures. Parallel implementation of recursive bisection on multi-core CPUs and GPUs are presented for large-scale graphs with up to 1.9 billion tetrahedra. The suggested approach exhibits improvements of up to 52.8\% over METIS for graphs originating from triangular Delaunay meshes, 34.7\% over METIS and 21.9\% over KaHIP for power network graphs, 40.8\% over METIS and 20.6\% over KaHIP for sparse matrix graphs, and finally 93.2\% over METIS for graphs emerging from social networks.},

Moreover, with the proliferation of parallel architectures and programming paradigms, the typical scientist is faced with a plethora of questions that must be answered in order to obtain an acceptable parallel implementation of the solution algorithm. In this paper, we consider three representative irregular applications: unstructured remeshing, sparse matrix computations, and N-body problems, and parallelize them using various popular programming paradigms on a wide spectrum of computing platforms ranging from state-of-the-art supercomputers to PC clusters. We present the underlying problems, the solution algorithms, and the parallel implementation strategies.

  abstract     = {The sparse triangular solve kernels, SpTRSV and SpTRSM, are important building blocks for a number of numerical linear algebra routines. Parallelizing SpTRSV and SpTRSM on today's manycore platforms, such as GPUs, is not an easy task since computing a component of the solution may depend on previously computed components, enforcing a degree of sequential processing. As a consequence, most existing work introduces a preprocessing stage to partition the components into a group of level-sets or colour-sets so that components within a set are independent and can be processed simultaneously during the subsequent solution stage. However, this class of methods requires a long preprocessing time as well as significant runtime synchronization overheads between the sets. To address this, we propose in this paper novel approaches for SpTRSV and SpTRSM in which the ordering between components is naturally enforced within the solution stage. In this way, the cost for preprocessing can be greatly reduced, and the synchronizations between sets are completely eliminated. To further exploit the data-parallelism, we also develop an adaptive scheme for efficiently processing multiple right-hand sides in SpTRSM. A comparison with a state-of-the-art library supplied by the GPU vendor, using 20 sparse matrices on the latest GPU device, shows that the proposed approach obtains an average speedup of over two for SpTRSV and up to an order of magnitude speedup for SpTRSM. In addition, our method is up to two orders of magnitude faster for the preprocessing stage than existing SpTRSV and SpTRSM methods.},

These triangular systems are challenging to solve efficiently on computers with high levels of concurrency. On such computers, it has recently been proposed to use Jacobi iterations, which are highly parallel, to approximately solve the triangular systems from incomplete factorizations. The effectiveness of this approach, however, is problem-dependent: the Jacobi iterations may not always converge quickly enough for all problems. Thus, as a necessary and important step to evaluate this approach, we experimentally test the approach on a large number of realistic symmetric positive definite problems. We also show that by using block Jacobi iterations, we can extend the range of problems for which such an approach can be effective. For block Jacobi iterations, it is essential for the blocking to be cognizant of the matrix structure.},

Although many SpGEMM algorithms have been proposed, hardware specific optimizations for multi- and many-core processors are lacking and a detailed analysis of their performance under various use cases and matrices is not available. We firstly identify and mitigate multiple bottlenecks with memory management and thread scheduling on Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing or KNL). Specifically targeting multi- and many-core processors, we develop a hash-table-based algorithm and optimize a heap-based shared-memory SpGEMM algorithm. We examine their performance together with other publicly available codes. Different from the literature, our evaluation also includes use cases that are representative of real graph algorithms, such as multi-source breadth-first search or triangle counting. Our hash-table and heap-based algorithms are showing significant speedups from libraries in the majority of the cases while different algorithms dominate the other scenarios with different matrix size, sparsity, compression factor and operation type. We wrap up in-depth evaluation results and make a recipe to give the best SpGEMM algorithm for target scenario. A critical finding is that hash-table-based SpGEMM gets a significant performance boost if the nonzeros are not required to be sorted within each row of the output matrix.}

Novel parallel hardware and algorithms only slightly improve these issues due to the increasing size of the problems. While high accuracy is inevitable for most problems, there are parts in scientific computing that allow us to introduce approximation. Therefore, in this paper we give answers to the following questions: (1) Can we exploit different approximate computing strategies in scientific computing? (2) Is there a strategy to combine approaches? To answer these questions, we apply different approximation strategies to a widely used iterative solver for linear systems of equations. We show the advantages and the limits of each strategy and a way to configure a combination of strategies according to a given relative error. Combining orthogonal strategies as an overall concept gives us significant opportunities to increase the performance.}

Our algorithms expect the sparse input in the popular compressed-sparse-row (CSR) format and thus do not require expensive format conversion. While previous SpMM work concentrates on thread-level parallelism, we additionally focus on latency hiding with instruction-level parallelism and load-balancing. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the proposed SpMM is a better fit for the GPU than previous approaches. We identify a key memory access pattern that allows efficient access into both input and output matrices that is crucial to getting excellent performance on SpMM. By combining these two ingredients -- (i) merge-based load-balancing and (ii) row-major coalesced memory access -- we demonstrate a 3.6x peak speedup and a 23.5\% geomean speedup over state-of-the-art SpMM implementations on real-world datasets.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we consider the problem of computing a triangular factorization of a sparse symmetric matrix using Gaussian elimination. We assume that the sparse matrix has been permuted using a fill-reducing ordering algorithm. When the matrix is symmetric positive definite, the sparsity structure of the triangular factor can be determined once the fill-reducing ordering has been computed. Thus, an efficient numerical factorization scheme can be designed so that only the nonzero entries are stored and operated on. On modern architectures, the positions of the nonzero entries in the triangular factor play a big role in determining the efficiency. It is desirable to have dense blocks in the factor so that the computation can be cast in terms of level-3 BLAS as much as possible. On architectures with GPUs, for example, it is also desirable for these dense blocks to be as large as possible in order to reduce the times to transfer data between the main CPU and the GPUs. We address the problem of locally refining the ordering so that the number of dense blocks is reduced and the sizes of these dense blocks are increased in the triangular factor.}

  date       = {2018},
  abstract   = {Analyzing array-based computations to determine data dependences is useful for many applications including automatic parallelization, race detection, computation and communication overlap, verification, and shape analysis. For sparse matrix codes, array data dependence analysis is made more difficult by the use of index arrays that make it possible to store only the nonzero entries of the matrix (e.g., in A[B[i]], B is an index array). Here, dependence analysis is often stymied by such indirect array accesses due to the values of the index array not being available at compile time. Consequently, many dependences cannot be proven unsatisfiable or determined until runtime. Nonetheless, index arrays in sparse matrix codes often have properties such as monotonicity of index array elements that can be exploited to reduce the amount of runtime analysis needed. In this paper, we contribute a formulation of array data dependence analysis that includes encoding index array properties as universally quantified constraints. This makes it possible to leverage existing SMT solvers to determine whether such dependences are unsatisfiable and significantly reduces the number of dependences that require runtime analysis in a set of eight sparse matrix kernels. Another contribution is an algorithm for simplifying the remaining satisfiable data dependences by discovering equalities and/or subset relationships. These simplifications are essential to make a runtime-inspection-based approach feasible.},

They arise frequently as part of direct and iterative solvers for linear systems and eigenvalue problems, and hence can be considered as a key building block of sparse numerical linear algebra. This is why, since the early days, their parallel solution has been exhaustively studied, and efficient implementations of this kernel can be found for almost every hardware platform. In the GPU context, the most widespread implementation of this kernel is the one distributed in NVIDIA CUSPARSE library, which relies on a preprocessing stage to aggregate the unknowns of the triangular system into level sets. This determines an execution schedule for the solution of the system, where the level sets have to be processed sequentially while the unknowns that belong to one level set can be solved in parallel. One of the disadvantages of the CUSPARSE implementation is that this preprocessing stage is often extremely slow in comparison to the runtime of the solving phase. In this work, we present a parallel GPU algorithm that is able to compute the same level sets as CU S PARSE but takes significantly less runtime. Our experiments on a set of matrices from the SuiteSparse collection show acceleration factors of up to 44$\times$. Additionally, we provide a routine capable of solving a triangular linear system on the same pass used to calculate the level sets, yielding important performance benefits.},

SMATER leverages a machine-learning model and retargetable back-end library to quickly predict the optimal combination. Performance parameters are extracted from 2,386 matrices in the SuiteSparse matrix collection.

Compared with the Intel MKL library, SMATER runs faster by more than 2.5 times on average.

  abstract  = {The sparse triangular solver (SpTRSV) is one of the most essential kernels in many scientific and engineering applications. Efficiently parallelizing the SpTRSV on modern many-core architectures is considerably difficult due to inherent dependency of computation and discontinuous memory accesses. Achieving high performance of SpTRSV is even more challenging for SW26010, the new-generation customized heterogeneous many-core processor equipped in the top-rank Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Owing to regular sparse pattern, structured-grid triangular problems show much different computing characteristics with general ones as well as new opportunities to algorithm design on many-core architectures, which ever lacks attention. In this work, we focus on how to design and implement fast SpTRSV for structured-grid problems on SW26010. A generalized algorithm framework of parallel SpTRSV is proposed for best utilization of the features and flexibilities of SW26010 many-core architecture according to the fine-grained Producer-Consumer model. Moreover, a novel parallel structured-grid SpTRSV is presented by using direct data transfers across registers of the computing elements of SW26010. Experiments on four typical structured-grid triangular problems with different problem sizes demonstrate that our SpTRSV can achieve an average momory bandwidth utilization of 79.7\% according to the stream benchmark, which leads to a speedup of 17.7 over serial version on SW26010. Furthermore, experiments with real world sparse linear problems show that our proposed SpTRSV can achieve superior preconditioning performance over the Intel Xeon E5-2670 v3 CPU and Intel Xeon Phi 7210 KNL over DDR4 memory.},

Spatial and temporal hypergraph models in these methods are extended to encapsulate both spatial and temporal localities based on cut/uncut net categorization obtained from vertex partitioning. These extensions of spatial and temporal hypergraph models encode the spatial locality primarily and the temporal locality secondarily, and vice-versa, respectively. However, the literature lacks models that simultaneously encode both spatial and temporal localities utilizing only vertex partitioning for further improving the performance of SpMV on shared-memory architectures. In order to fill this gap, we propose a novel spatiotemporal hypergraph model that leads to a one-phase spatiotemporal reordering method which encodes both types of locality simultaneously. We also propose a framework for spatiotemporal methods which encodes both types of locality in two dependent phases and two separate phases. The validity of the proposed spatiotemporal models and methods are tested on a wide range of sparse matrices and the experiments are performed on both a 60-core Intel Xeon Phi processor and a Xeon processor. Results show the validity of the methods via almost doubling the Gflop/s performance through enhancing data locality in parallel SpMV operations.},

This work addresses this shortcoming by proposing new fine-grain and medium-grain models that are able to minimize communication volume and message count in a single partitioning phase. The new models utilize message nets in order to encapsulate the minimization of total message count. We further fine-tune these models by proposing delayed addition and thresholding for message nets in order to establish a trade-off between the conflicting objectives of minimizing communication volume and message count. The experiments on an extensive dataset of nearly one thousand matrices show that the proposed models improve the total message count of the original nonzero-based models by up to 27\% on the average, which is reflected on the parallel runtime of SpMV as an average reduction of 15\% on 512 processors.},

In this work, we give a distributed memory parallel algorithm to compute high-quality edge partitions in a scalable way. Our algorithm scales to networks with billions of edges, and runs efficiently on thousands of PEs. Our technique is based on a fast parallelization of split graph construction and a use of advanced node partitioning algorithms.

While being a well known technique, its successful modification, software development, and adjustment to match architecture specifics, is challenging. For current manycore GPUs the challenges range from efficient parallelization to scaling, and using the FP16 arithmetic. Here, we address these challenges by showing how to algorithmically modify, develop high-performance implementations, and in general, how to use the FP16 arithmetic to significantly accelerate, as well as make more energy efficient, FP64-precision Ax = b solvers.

  abstract    = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), the problem of finding two non-negative low-rank factors whose product approximates an input matrix, is a useful tool for many data mining and scientific applications such as topic modeling in text mining and blind source separation in microscopy. In this paper, we focus on scaling algorithms for NMF to very large sparse datasets and massively parallel machines by employing effective algorithms, communication patterns, and partitioning schemes that leverage the sparsity of the input matrix. In the case of machine learning workflow, the computations after SpMM must deal with dense matrices, as Sparse-Dense matrix multiplication will result in a dense matrix. Hence, the partitioning strategy considering only SpMM will result in a huge imbalance in the overall workflow especially on computations after SpMM and in this specific case of NMF on non-negative least squares computations. Towards this, we consider two previous works developed for related problems, one that uses a fine-grained partitioning strategy using a point-to-point communication pattern and on that uses a checkerboard partitioning strategy using a collective-based communication pattern. We show that a combination of the previous approaches balances the demands of the various computations within NMF algorithms and achieves high efficiency and scalability. From the experiments, we could see that our proposed algorithm communicates atleast 4x less than the collective and achieves upto 100$\times$ speed up over the baseline FAUN on real world datasets. Our algorithm was experimented in two different super computing platforms and we could scale up to 32000 processors on Bluegene/Q.},

Many implementations based on different sparse formats were proposed to improve this kernel on the recent GPU architectures. However, it has been widely observed that there is no “best-for-all” sparse format for the SpMV kernel on GPU. Indeed, serious performance degradation of an order of magnitude can be observed without a careful selection of the sparse format to use. To address this problem, we propose in this article BestSF (Best Sparse Format), a new learning-based sparse meta-format that automatically selects the most appropriate sparse format for a given input matrix. To do so, BestSF relies on a cost-sensitive classification system trained using Weighted Support Vector Machines (WSVMs) to predict the best sparse format for each input sparse matrix. Our experimental results on two different NVIDIA GPU architectures using a large number of real-world sparse matrices show that BestSF achieved a noticeable overall performance improvement over using a single sparse format. While BestSF is trained to select the best sparse format in terms of performance (GFLOPS), our further experimental investigations revealed that using BestSF also led, in most of the test cases, to the best energy efficiency (MFLOPS/W). To prove its practical effectiveness, we also evaluate the performance and energy efficiency improvement achieved when using BestSF as a building block in a GPU-based Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) iterative solver.},

Properties of the preconditioner derived from the ILU factorization are relayed onto the dropping rules. Recently, Zhang et al. (Numer Linear Algebra Appl 19:555--569, 2011) proposed a Flexible incomplete Cholesky (IC) factorization for symmetric linear systems. This paper is a study of the extension of the IC factorization to the nonsymmetric case. The new algorithm is called the Crout version of the flexible ILU factorization, and attempts to reduce the number of nonzero elements in the preconditioner and computation time during the GMRES iterations. Numerical results show that our approach is effective and useful.}

We describe and test a strategy for identifying nonzeros to be added and nonzeros to be removed from the sparsity pattern. The resulting pattern may be different and more effective than that of existing threshold ILU algorithms. Also in contrast to other parallel threshold ILU algorithms, much of the new algorithm has fine-grained parallelism.}

The resonant  frequencies  of  the  low-order  modes  are  the  eigenvalues  of  the  smallest  real  part  of  a  complex symmetric  (though  non-Hermitian)  matrix  pencil.  These  type  of  pencils  arise  in  the  FEM analysis  of resonant cavities loaded with a lossy material. To accelerate the computations, graphics processing units (GPU, NVIDIA Pascal P100) were used. Single and dual-GPU variants are considered and a GPU-memory-saving implementation is proposed. An efficient sliced ELLR-T sparse matrix storage format was used and operations were performed on blocks of vectors for best performance on a GPU. As a result, significant speedups (exceeding a factor of six in some computational scenarios) were achieved over the reference parallel implementation using a multicore central processing unit (CPU, Intel Xeon E5-2680 v3, twelve cores). These results indicate that the solution of generalized eigenproblems needs much more GPU memory than iterative techniques when solving a sparse system of equations, and also requires a second GPU to store some data structures in order to reduce the footprint, even for a moderately large systems.},

In the Jacobi-Davidson/Riccati method the correction equation is solved with/without linearization. In the literature, avoiding the linearization is known as an improvement to get a better solution of the equation and bring the faster convergence. In fact, the Riccati method showed superior convergence behavior for some problems. Nevertheless the advantage of the Riccati method is still unclear, because the correction equation is solved not exactly but with low accuracy. In this paper, we analyzed the approximate solution of the correction equation and clarified the point that the Riccati method is specialized for computing particular solutions of eigenvalue problems. The result suggests that the two methods should be selectively used depending on target solutions. Our analysis was verified by numerical experiments.}

  date       = {2018},
  abstract   = {The Cholesky QR algorithm is an efficient communication-minimizing algorithm for computing the QR factorization of a tall-skinny matrix. Unfortunately it has the inherent numerical instability and breakdown when the matrix is ill-conditioned. A recent work establishes that the instability can be cured by repeating the algorithm twice (called CholeskyQR2). However, the applicability of CholeskyQR2 is still limited by the requirement that the Cholesky factorization of the Gram matrix runs to completion, which means it does not always work for matrices X with $\kappa_2(X) \ge u^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ where $u$ is the unit roundoff. In this work we extend the applicability to $\kappa_2(X)=\mathcal{O}(u^{-1})$ by introducing a shift to the computed Gram matrix so as to guarantee the Cholesky factorization $R^T R = A^T A+sI$ succeeds numerically. We show that the computed $A R^{-1}$ has reduced condition number ${} \le u^{-\frac{1}{2*}}$, for which CholeskyQR2 safely computes the QR factorization, yielding a computed Q of orthogonality $\mid Q^T Q - I\mid_2$ and residual $\mid A-QR\mid _F/\mid A\mid_F$ both $\mathcal{O}(u)$. Thus we obtain the required QR factorization by essentially running Cholesky QR thrice. We extensively analyze the resulting algorithm shiftedCholeskyQR to reveal its excellent numerical stability. shiftedCholeskyQR is also highly parallelizable, and applicable and effective also when working in an oblique inner product space. We illustrate our findings through experiments, in which we achieve significant (up to $\times$40) speedup over alternative methods.},

To achieve high performance, in-memory data must be prefetched into fast on-chip caches before they are used. Two techniques, software prefetching and data packing, have been used to effectively exploit the capability of on-chip least recent used (LRU) caches, which are popular in traditional high-performance processors used in high-end servers and supercomputers. However, the market has recently witnessed a new diversity in processor design, resulting in high-performance processors equipped with shared caches with non-LRU replacement policies. This poses a challenge to the development of high-performance GEMM in a multithreaded context. As several threads try to load data into a shared cache simultaneously, interthread cache conflicts will increase significantly. We present a Shared Cache Partitioning (SCP) method to eliminate interthread cache conflicts in the GEMM routines, by partitioning a shared cache into physically disjoint sets and assigning different sets to different threads. We have implemented SCP in the OpenBLAS library and evaluated it on Phytium 2000+, a 64-core AArch64 processor with private LRU L1 caches and shared pseudo-random L2 caches (per four-core cluster). Our evaluation shows that SCP has effectively reduced the conflict misses in both L1 and L2 caches in a highly optimized GEMM implementation, resulting in an improvement of its performance by 2.75\% to 6.91\%.},

The AMG method relies on a new approach for coarsening sparse symmetric positive definite (s.p.d.) matrices, named coarsening based on compatible weighted matching. It exploits maximum weight matching in the adjacency graph of the sparse matrix, driven by the principle of compatible relaxation, providing a suitable aggregation of unknowns which goes beyond the limits of the usual heuristics applied in the current methods. We adopt an approximate solution of the maximum weight matching problem, based on a recently proposed parallel algorithm, referred as the Suitor algorithm, and show that it allow us to obtain good quality coarse matrices for our AMG on GPUs. We exploit inherent parallelism of modern GPUs in all the kernels involving sparse matrix computations both for the setup of the preconditioner and for its application in a Krylov solver, outperforming preconditioners available in Nvidia AmgX library. We report results about a large set of linear systems arising from discretization of scalar and vector partial differential equations (PDEs).}

  abstract = {Graph partitioning arises in many computational simulation workloads, including those that involve finite difference or finite element methods, where partitioning enables efficient parallel processing of the entire simulation. We focus on parallel geometric algorithms for partitioning large graphs whose vertices are associated with coordinates in two-or three-dimensional space on multi-core processors. Compared with other types of partitioning algorithms, geometric schemes generally show better scalability on a large number of processors or cores. This paper studies the scalability and sensitivity of two parallel algorithms, namely, recursive coordinate bisection (denoted by pRCB) and geometric mesh partitioning (denoted by pGMP), in terms of their robustness to several key factors that affect the partition quality, including coordinate perturbation, approximate embedding, mesh quality and graph planarity. Our results indicate that the quality of a partition as measured by the size of the edge separator (or cutsize) remains consistently better for pGMP compared to pRCB. On average for our test suite, relative to pRCB, pGMP yields 25\% smaller cutsizes on the original embedding, and across all perturbations cutsizes that are smaller by at least 8\% and by as much as 50\%. Not surprisingly, higher quality cuts are obtained at the expense of longer execution times; on a single core, pGMP has an average execution time that is almost 10 times slower than that of pRCB, but it scales better and catches up at 32-cores to be slower by less than 20\%. With the current trends in core counts that continue to increase per chip, these results suggest that pGMP presents an attractive solution if a modest number of cores can be deployed to reduce execution times while providing high quality partitions.}

BiCGSTAB has been most often used for efficiently solving the linear equations, but we have sometimes seen the convergence behavior with a long stagnation phase. In such cases, it is important to have Bi-CG coefficients that are as accurate as possible, and the stabilization strategy for improving the accuracy of the Bi-CG coefficients has been proposed. In present petascale high-performance computing hardware, the main bottleneck of Krylov subspace methods for efficient parallelization is the inner products which require a global reduction. The parallel variants of BiCGSTAB such as communication avoiding and pipelined BiCGSTAB reducing the number of global communication phases and hiding the communication latency have been proposed. However, the numerical stability, specifically, the convergence speed of the parallel variants of BiCGSTAB has not previously been clarified on problems with situations where the convergence is slow (strongly affected by rounding errors). In this paper, therefore, we examine the convergence speed between the standard BiCGSTAB and the parallel variants, and the effectiveness of the stabilization strategy by numerical experiments on the problems where the convergence has a long stagnation phase.}

  abstract   = {This paper addresses spatial programming of sparse matrix computations for productive performance. The challenge is how to express an irregular computation and its optimizations in a regular way.

A sparse matrix has (non-zero) values and a structure. In this paper, we propose to classify the implementations of a computation on a sparse matrix into two categories: (1) structure-driven, or top-down, approach, which traverses the structure with given row and column indices and locates the corresponding values, and (2) values-driven, or bottom-up, approach, which loads and processes the values in parallel streams, and decodes the structure for the values' corresponding row and column indices. On a spatial architecture like FPGAs, the values-driven approach is the norm. We show how to express a sparse matrix computation and its optimizations for a values-driven implementation. A compiler automatically synthesizes a code to decode the structure. In this way, programmers focus on optimizing the processing of the values, using familiar optimizations for dense matrices, while leaving the complex, irregular structure traversal to an automatic compiler. We also attempt to regularize the optimizations of the reduction for a dynamic number of values, which is common in a sparse matrix computation.},

As the name suggests, Krylov subspace methods can be viewed as a sequence of projections onto nested subspaces of increasing dimension. They are therefore by their nature implemented as synchronized recurrences. This is the fundamental obstacle to efficient parallel implementation. Standard approaches to overcoming this obstacle described in the literature involve reducing the number of global synchronization points and increasing parallelism in performing arithmetic operations within individual iterations. One such approach, employed by the so-called pipelined Krylov subspace methods, involves overlapping the global communication needed for computing inner products with local arithmetic computations. Inexact computations in Krylov subspace methods, due to either floating point roundoff error or intentional action motivated by savings in computing time or energy consumption, have two basic effects, namely, slowing down convergence and limiting attainable accuracy. Although the methodologies for their investigation are different, these phenomena are closely related and cannot be separated from one another. The study of mathematical properties of Krylov subspace methods, in both the cases of exact and inexact computations, is a very active area of research and many issues in the analytic theory of Krylov subspace methods remain open. Numerical stability issues have been studied since the formulation of the conjugate gradient method in the middle of the last century, with many remarkable results achieved since then. Recently, the issues of attainable accuracy and delayed convergence caused by inexact computations became of interest in relation to pipelined conjugate gradient methods and their generalizations. In this contribution we recall the related early results and developments in synchronization-reducing conjugate gradient methods, identify the main factors determining possible numerical instabilities, and present a methodology for the analysis and understanding of pipelined conjugate gradient methods. We derive an expression for the residual gap that applies to any conjugate gradient method variant that uses a particular auxiliary vector in updating the residual, including pipelined conjugate gradient methods, and show how this result can be used to perform a full-scale analysis for a particular implementation. The paper concludes with a brief perspective on Krylov subspace methods in the forthcoming exascale era.}

Volume 8, 235-237, 2018] when using a sequential task flow (STF) model. In the context of direct methods, the solution of a sparse linear system is achieved through three main phases: the analyse, the factorization and the solve phases. In the last two phases which involve numerical computation, the factorization corresponds to the most computationally costly phase, and it is therefore crucial to parallelize this phase in order to reduce the time-to-solution on modern architectures. As a consequence, the solve phase is often not as optimized as the factorization in state-of-the-art solvers and opportunities for parallelism are often not exploited in this phase. However, in some applications, the time spent in the solve phase is comparable or even greater than the time for the factorization and the user could dramatically benefit from a faster solve routine. This is the case, for example, for a CG solver using a block Jacobi preconditioner. The diagonal blocks are factorized once only but their factors are used to solve subsystems at each CG iteration. In this study we design and implement a parallel version of a task-based solve routine for an OpenMP version of the SpLLT solver. We show that we can obtain good scalability on a multicore architecture enabling a dramatic reduction of the overall time-to-solution in some applications.}

These bounds unify, extend or improve all known upper and lower complexity bounds for unconstrained and convexly-constrained problems. It is shown that, given an accuracy level $\epsilon$, a degree of highest available Lipschitz continuous derivatives $p$ and a desired optimality order $q$ between one and $p$, a conceptual regularization algorithm requires no more than $O(\epsilon^{-\frac{p+1}{p-q+1}}$ evaluations of the objective function and its derivatives to compute a suitably approximate $q$-th order minimizer. With an appropriate choice of the regularization, a similar result also holds if the $p$-th derivative is merely Holder rather than Lipschitz continuous. We provide an example that shows that the above complexity bound is sharp for unconstrained and a wide class of constrained problems; we also give reasons for the optimality of regularization methods from a worst-case complexity point of view, within a large class of algorithms that use the same derivative information.}

  abstract    = {The fast and accurate solution of large size sparse systems of linear equations is at the heart of numerical applications from a very broad range of domains including structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, geophysics, medical imaging, chemistry. Among the most commonly used techniques, direct methods, based on the factorization of the system matrix, are generally appreciated for their numerical robustness and ease of use. These advantages, however, come at the price of a considerable operations count and memory footprint. The work presented in this thesis is concerned with improving the scalability of sparse direct solvers, intended as the ability to solve problems of larger and larger size. More precisely, our work aims at developing solvers which are scalable in performance, memory consumption and complexity. We address performance scalability, that is the ability to reduce the execution time as more computational resources are available, introducing algorithms that improve parallelism by reducing communications and synchronizations. We discuss the use of novel parallel programming paradigms and tools to achieve their implementation in an efficient and portable way on modern, heterogeneous supercomputers. We present methods that make sparse direct solvers memory-scalable, that is, capable of taking advantage of parallelism without increasing the overall memory footprint. Finally we show how it is possible to use data sparsity to achieve an asymptotic reduction of the cost of such methods. The presented algorithms have been implemented in the freely distributed MUMPS and qr_mumps solver packages and their effectiveness assessed on real life problems from academic and industrial applications.},

The placement of data on these memories has a tremendous impact on the performance of the HPC applications and identifying the optimal placement location is non-trivial.\\
In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach to build a classifier to determine the best class of GPU memory that will minimize GPU kernel execution time. This approach utilizes a set of performance counters obtained from profiling runs along with hardware features to generate the trained model. We evaluate our approach on several generations of NVIDIA GPUs, including Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta on a set of benchmarks. The results show that the trained model achieves prediction accuracy over 90\% and given a global version, the classifier can accurately determine which data placement variant would yield the best performance.},

To address this problem, GraphBLAS is an innovative on-going effort by the graph analytics community to formulate graph algorithms as sparse linear algebra, so that they can be expressed in a performant, succinct and in a backend-agnostic manner. Initial research efforts in implementing GraphBLAS on GPUs for graph processing and analytics have been promising, but challenges such as feature-incompleteness and poor performance still exist compared to their vertex-centric (“think like a vertex”) graph framework counterparts. For our thesis, we propose a multi-language graph framework aiming to simplify the development of graph algorithms, which 1) provides a multi-language GraphBLAS interface for the end-users to express, develop, and refine graph algorithms more succinctly than existing distributed graph frameworks; 2) abstracts away from the end-users performance tuning decisions; 3) utilizes the advantages of existing low-level GPU computing primitives to maintain high performance.}

As a result, programmers must try different combinations of a large set of techniques, which make tradeoffs among locality, work-efficiency, and parallelism, to develop the best implementation for a specific algorithm and type of graph. Existing graph frameworks and domain specific languages (DSLs) lack flexibility, supporting only a limited set of optimizations.\\
This paper introduces GraphIt, a new DSL for graph computations that generates fast implementations for algorithms with different performance characteristics running on graphs with different sizes and structures. GraphIt separates what is computed (algorithm) from how it is computed (schedule). Programmers specify the algorithm using an algorithm language, and performance optimizations are specified using a separate scheduling language. The algorithm language simplifies expressing the algorithms, while exposing opportunities for optimizations. We formulate graph optimizations, including edge traversal direction, data layout, parallelization, cache, NUMA, and kernel fusion optimizations, as tradeoffs among locality, parallelism, and work-efficiency. The scheduling language enables programmers to easily search through this complicated tradeoff space by composing together a large set of edge traversal, vertex data layout, and program structure optimizations. The separation of algorithm and schedule also enables us to build an autotuner on top of GraphIt to automatically find high-performance schedules. The compiler uses a new scheduling representation, the graph iteration space, to model, compose, and ensure the validity of the large number of optimizations. We evaluate GraphIt's performance with seven algorithms on graphs with different structures and sizes. GraphIt outperforms the next fastest of six state-of-the-art shared-memory frameworks (Ligra, Green-Marl, GraphMat, Galois, Gemini, and Grazelle) on 24 out of 32 experiments by up to 4.8$\times$, and is never more than 43\% slower than the fastest framework on the other experiments. GraphIt also reduces the lines of code by up to an order of magnitude compared to the next fastest framework.},

  abstract     = {In this article we introduce an inner parallel cutting plane method (IPCP) to compute good feasible points for mixed-integer convex optimization problems. The method iteratively generates polyhedral outer approximations of an enlarged inner parallel set (EIPS) of the continuously relaxed feasible set. This EIPS possesses the crucial property that any rounding of any of its elements is feasible for the original problem. The outer approximations are refined in each iteration by using modified Kelley cutting planes, which are defined via rounded optimal points of linear opti- mization problems (LPs).\\ We show that the method either computes a feasible point or certifies that the EIPS is empty. Moreover, we provide bounds on the objective value of the generated feasible point. As there exist consistent problems which possess an empty EIPS, the IPCP is not guaranteed to find a feasible point for the latter. Yet, the crucial advantage of the method lies in the complexity of each iteration: While other approaches need to solve a mixed-integer linear optimization problem, the IPCP only needs to solve an LP, which can be carried out efficiently. Our computational study indicates that the IPCP is able to quickly find feasible points for many practical applications. It further demonstrates that the objective values of the computed feasible points are generally of good quality and sometimes not easily obtainable by other methods.},

Most of these simulations are centered on the solution of systems of non-linear equations, that, once linearized, become a sequence of linear systems, whose solution is often the most time-demanding task. Thus, in order to increase the capability of modeling larger cases, it is of paramount importance to exploit the resources of High Performance Computing architectures. In this framework, the development of new algorithms to accelerate the solution of linear systems for many-core architectures is a really active research field.  Our main focus is algebraic preconditioning and, among the various options, we elect to develop approximate inverses for symmetric and positive definite (SPD) linear systems [22], both as stand-alone preconditioner or smoother for AMG techniques. This choice is mainly supported by the almost perfect parallelism that intrinsically characterizes these algorithms. As basic kernel, the Factorized Sparse Approximate Inverse (FSAI) developed in its adaptive form by Janna and Ferronato [18] is selected. Recent developments are i) a robust multilevel approach for SPD problems based on FSAI preconditioning, which eliminates the chance of algorithmic breakdowns independently of the preconditioner sparsity [14] and ii) a novel AMG approach featuring the adaptive FSAI method as a flexible smoother as well as new approaches to adaptively compute the prolongation operator. In this latter work, a new technique to build the prolongation is also presented.},

In practical applications, large-scale spare matrices are usually used for calculation. During these years, Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) has become a powerful platform for high-performance computing, and optimizing$S$pMV on GPU based systems for efficient performance is the principal interest in many researches. In this paper, we proposed a new method to optimize SpMV on GPUs via index compression. Our index compression method can reduce the index value of the access space. The memory space for recording each column index is significantly reduced from two bytes to one byte, which outperforms the previous work on access performance. The main contributions we make are as follows: (1) Only one byte for each column index is required, which can significantly reduce the working set of the column index and further improve the cache hit ration. (2) Our method can be applied to any kind of matrices, while the previous work can only apply to subset of the matrices. Computational experiments on problems according to the previous work reveal that the best performance improvement ration for ours is up to about 1.5.},

Javelin allows for improved parallel factorization on shared-memory many-core systems, while packaging the coefficient matrix into a format that allows for high performance sparse matrix-vector multiplication and sparse triangular solves with minimal overheads. The framework achieves these goals by using a collection of traditional permutations, point-to-point thread synchronizations, tasking, and segmented prefix scans in a conventional compressed sparse row format. Using these changes, traditional fill-in and drop tolerance methods can be used, while still being able to have observed speedups of up to ~42$\times$ on 68 Intel Knights Landing cores and ~12$\times$ on 14 Intel Haswell cores.},

Our technique decomposes the synthesis task into alternating steps of query synthesis and incrementalization. The query synthesis step implements pure operations over the data structure state by leveraging existing enumerative synthesis techniques, specialized to the data structures domain. The incrementalization step implements imperative state modifications by re-framing them as fresh queries that determine what to change, coupled with a small amount of code to apply the change. As an added benefit of this approach over previous work, the synthesized data structure is optimized for not only the queries in the specification but also the required update operations. We have evaluated our approach in four large case studies, demonstrating that these extensions are broadly applicable.},

  abstract  = {We introduce the concept of design continuums for the data layout of key-value stores. A design continuum unifies major distinct data structure designs under the same model. The critical insight and potential long-term impact is that such unifying models 1)~render what we consider up to now as fundamentally different data structures to be seen as views'' of the very same overall design space, and 2)~allow seeing'' new data structure designs with performance properties that are not feasible by existing designs. The core intuition behind the construction of design continuums is that all data structures arise from the very same set of fundamental design principles, i.e., a small set of data layout design concepts out of which we can synthesize any design that exists in the literature as well as new ones. We show how to construct, evaluate, and expand, design continuums and we also present the first continuum that unifies major data structure designs, i.e., B+Tree, BeTree, LSM-tree, and LSH-Table.\\The practical benefit of a design continuum is that it creates a fast inference engine for the design of data structures. For example, we can near instantly predict how a specific design change in the underlying storage of a data system would affect performance, or reversely what would be the optimal data structure (from a given set of designs) given workload characteristics and a memory budget. In turn, these properties allow us to envision a new class of self-designing key-value stores with a substantially improved ability to adapt to workload and hardware changes by transitioning between drastically different data structure designs to assume a diverse set of performance properties at will.}

  abstract    = {The factorization of sparse symmetric indefinite systems is particularly challenging since pivoting is required to maintain stability of the factorization. Pivoting techniques generally offer limited parallelism and are associated with significant data movement hindering the scalability of these methods. Variants of the Threshold Partial Pivoting (TPP) algorithm for example have been often used because of its numerical robustness but standard implementations exhibit poor parallel performance. On the other hand, some methods trade stability for performance on parallel architectures such as the Supernode Bunch-Kaufman (SBK) used in the PARDISO solver. In this case, however, the factors obtained might not be used to accurately compute the solution of the system. For this reason we have designed a task-based $LDL^T$ factorization algorithm based on a new pivoting strategy called A Posteriori Threshold Pivoting (APTP) that is much more suitable for modern multicore architectures and has the same numerical robustness as the TPP strategy. We implemented our algorithm in a new version of the SPRAL Sparse Symmetric Indefinite Direct Solver (SSIDS) which initially supported GPU-only factorization. We have used OpenMP 4 task features to implement a multifrontal algorithm with dense factorizations using the novel APTP, and we show that it performs favourably compared to the state-of-the-art solvers HSL_MA86, HSL_MA97 and PARDISO both in terms of performance on a multicore machine and in terms of numerical robustness. Finally we show that this new solver is able to make use of GPU devices for accelerating the factorization on heterogeneous architectures.}

The approximate methods constitute a useful solution for these types of problems. Thus, many research studies have focused on developing meta-heuristic algorithms to tackle the graph partitioning problem. Local search is one of the earliest methods that has been applied efficiently to this type of problem. Recent studies have explored various types of local search methods and have improved them such that they can be used with the partitioning process. Moreover, local search methods are widely integrated with population-based approaches, to provide the best diversification and intensification for the problem space. This study emphasizes the local search approaches, as well as their combination with other graph partitioning approaches. At present, none of the surveys in the literature has focused on this class of state of the art approaches in much detail. In this study, the vital parts of these approaches including neighborhood structure, acceptance criterion, and the ways of combining them with other approaches, are highlighted. Additionally, we provide an experimental comparison that shows the variance in the performance of the reviewed methods. Hence, this study clarifies these methods to show their advantages and limitations for the targeted problem, and thus can aid in the direction of research flow towards the area of graph partitioning.}

The HDB format stores sparse matrix hierarchically using tree structure. Each node of tree structure of HDB format store small sparse matrices using CSR format.\\
In this present study, we examined two problems with the HDB format and provided a solution for each problem.\\
First, SpMV using the HDB format has a partial dependent relationship among hierarchies. The problem with the HDB format is that the parallelism of computation decreases as the hierarchy of nodes gets closer to the root. Thus, we propose cutting of dependency using work vectors to solve this problem.\\
Second, each node of the conventional HDB format is stored in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. Block compressed Sparse Row (BSR) format often becomes faster than CSR format in SpMV performance. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method with work vectors also for BSR-HDB format.\\
In addition, we compare the performance in the general format (CSR format, BSR format) using the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), the conventional HDB format, and the expanded HDB format by using 22 types of sparse matrix that from various field. The results showed that the SpMV performance was highest in the HDB format that we expanded in 19 types of sparse matrix, which was 1.99 times faster than the CSR format.},

The proposed solution also alleviates scanning of input matrices multiple times by making use of Accumulo's batch scanning capability which is used for accessing multiple ranges of key-value pairs in parallel. Even though the use of batch-scanning introduces some latency overheads, these overheads are alleviated by the proposed solution and by using node-level parallelism structures. We also propose a matrix partitioning scheme which reduces the total communication volume and provides a balance of workload among servers. The results of extensive experiments performed on both real-world and synthetic sparse matrices show that the proposed algorithm scales significantly better than the outer-product parallel SpGEMM algorithm available in the Graphulo library.

  abstract  = {Tiling is a key technique for data locality optimization and is widely used in high-performance implementations of dense matrix-matrix multiplication for multicore/manycore CPUs and GPUs. However, the irregular and matrix-dependent data access pattern of sparse matrix multiplication makes it challenging to use tiling to enhance data reuse. In this paper, we devise an adaptive tiling strategy and apply it to enhance the performance of two primitives: SpMM (product of sparse matrix and dense matrix) and SDDMM (sampled dense-dense matrix multiplication). In contrast to studies that have resorted to non-standard sparse-matrix representations to enhance performance, we use the standard Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) representation, within which intra-row reordering is performed to enable adaptive tiling. Experimental evaluation using an extensive set of matrices from the Sparse Suite collection demonstrates significant performance improvement over currently available state-of-the-art alternatives.},

While both are equally important, this disparity can be attributed mainly to the additional formidable challenges raised by SpGEMM.\\ In this paper, we present a dynamic approach for addressing SpGEMM on the GPU. Our approach works directly on the standard compressed sparse rows (CSR) data format. In comparison to previous SpGEMM implementations, our approach guarantees a homogeneous, load-balanced access pattern to the first input matrix and improves memory access to the second input matrix. It adaptively re-purposes GPU threads during execution and maximizes the time efficient on-chip scratchpad memory can be used. Adhering to a completely deterministic scheduling pattern guarantees bit-stable results during repetitive execution, a property missing from other approaches. Evaluation on an extensive sparse matrix benchmark suggests our approach being the fastest SpGEMM implementation for highly sparse matrices (80\% of the set). When bit-stable results are sought, our approach is the fastest across the entire test set.},

First, we revisit the use of dual-GPU systems to execute independent stages of the BiCG concurrently on both accelerators, while leveraging the extra memory space to improve the data access patterns. In addition, we extend our ideas to compute the BiCG method efficiently in multicore platforms with a single GPU. In this line, we study the possibilities offered by hybrid CPU-GPU computations, as well as a novel synchronization-free sparse triangular linear solver. The experimental results with the new solvers show important acceleration factors with respect to the previous data-parallel CPU and GPU versions.},

One convenient feature of UPC is its ability to automatically execute betweenthread data movement, such that the entire content of a shared data array appears to be freely accessible by all the threads. .e programmer friendliness, however, can come at the cost of substantial performance penalties. .is is especially true when indirectly indexing the elements of a shared array, for which the induced between-thread data communication can be irregular and have a fine-grained pattern. In this paper, we study performance enhancement strategies specifically targeting such finegrained irregular communication in UPC. Starting from explicit thread privatization, continuing with block-wise communication, and arriving at message condensing and consolidation, we obtained considerable performance improvement of UPC programs that originally require fine-grained irregular communication. Besides the performance enhancement strategies, the main contribution of the present paper is to propose performance models for the different scenarios, in the form of quantifiable formulas that hinge on the actual volumes of various data movements plus a small number of easily obtainable hardware characteristic parameters. .ese performance models help to verify the enhancements obtained, while also providing insightful predictions of similar parallel implementations, not limited to UPC, that also involve between-thread or between-process irregular communication. As a further validation, we also apply our performance modeling methodology and hardware characteristic parameters to an existing UPC code for solving a 2D heat equation on a uniform mesh.},

However, the combination of dynamic scheduling of parallel computing resources, and floating point nonassociativity, makes attaining reproducibility a challenge even for simple reduction operations like computing the sum of a vector of numbers in parallel. We propose a technique for floating point summation that is reproducible independent of the order of summation. Our technique uses Rump's algorithm for error-free vector transformation [7], and is much more efficient than using (possibly very) high precision arithmetic. Our algorithm reproducibly computes highly accurate results with an absolute error bound of $n cdot 2^{-28} \cdot macheps \cdot max _i |v_i|$ at a cost of $7n$ FLOPs and a small constant amount of extra memory usage. Higher accuracies are also possible by increasing the number of error-free transformations. As long as all operations are performed in to-nearest rounding mode, results computed by the proposed algorithms are reproducible for any run on any platform. In particular, our algorithm requires the minimum number of reductions, i.e. one reduction of an array of six double precision floating point numbers per sum, and hence is well suited for massively parallel environments.}

On massively multi-threaded systems, the non-deterministic nature of how machine floating-point operations are interleaved, combined with the fact that intermediate values have to be rounded or truncated to fit in the available precision leads to non-deterministic numerical error propagation. We have investigated on a Cray XMT system the effect of non-deterministic error propagation by observing the convergence rate of a conjugate gradient calcula-tion used as part of a Power State Estimation (PSE) application. As a possible mitigation strategy, we have explored quadruple precision accumulation, as well as a deterministic parallel tree scheme. The tree based approach has consistently outperformed the quadruple precision approach due to an improved convergence rate. As a consequence, we motivate the need for compile time mechanisms that enable enforcement of parallel deterministic operations on the Cray XMT.}

These make the problem significantly harder to solve because their presence limits the direct applicability of sparse matrix techniques. In particular, the normal matrix is (close to) dense,
 so that forming it is impractical. One way to help overcome the dense row problem is to employ matrix stretching.
 Stretching is a sparse matrix technique that improves sparsity by making the least-squares problem larger.
 We show that standard stretching can still result in the normal matrix for the stretched problem having an unacceptably large amount of fill. This motivates us to propose a new sparse stretching strategy that performs the stretching so as to limit the fill in the normal matrix and its Cholesky factor. Numerical examples from real problems
 are used to illustrate the potential gains.},

In order to take full advantage of SIMD acceleration technology, a new storage format called Variable Blocked-$\sigma$-SIMD Format (VBSF) is proposed in this paper to change the irregular nature of traditional matrix storage formats. This format combines the adjacent nonzero elements into variable size blocks to ensure that SpMV can be computed with SIMD vector units. We compare the VBSF-based SpMV with traditional storage formats using 15 matrices as a benchmark suite on three computing platforms (FT2000, Intel Xeon E5 and Intel Silver) with different SIMD length. For the matrices in the benchmark suite, the VBSF obtains great performance improvement on three platforms, respectively, and it proves to have better storage efficiency compared with other storage formats.},

Therefore, they provide lower bounds on the execution time of any parallel schedule of an algorithm computed by a system composed of any number of homogeneous processors, each with associated computational, communication, and synchronization costs. We employ a theoretical model that measures the amount of work and data movement as a maximum over that incurred along any execution path during the parallel computation. By considering this metric rather than the total communication volume over the whole machine, we obtain new insights into the characteristics of parallel schedules for algorithms with nontrivial dependency structures. We also present reductions from BSP and LogGP algorithms to our execution model, extending our lower bounds to these two models of parallel computation. We first develop our results for general dependency graphs and hypergraphs based on their expansion properties, and then we apply the theorem to a number of specific algorithms in numerical linear algebra, namely triangular substitution, Cholesky factorization, and stencil computations. We represent some of these algorithms as families of dependency graphs. We derive their communication lower bounds by studying the communication requirements of the hypergraph structures shared by these dependency graphs. In addition to these lower bounds, we introduce a new communication-efficient parallelization for stencil computation algorithms, which is motivated by results of our lower bound analysis and the properties of previously existing parallelizations of the algorithms.},

  abstract  = {In many applications a sparse linear system of equations $Ax = b$ has to be solved. For applying iterative solvers like preconditioned conjugate gradient (pcg) or GMRES, effective preconditioners are necessary, e.g. Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, or incomplete LU factorization (ILU). Often, effective preconditioners are given via sparse triangular matrices $L$, that have to be solved in every iteration step. Recent work by Edmond Chow introduced an easy to parallelize fixed-point iteration for computing approximations to (I)LU factorizations. Therefore, the aching handicap in parallel solution methods for sparse matrices is the solving of sparse triangular systems, e.g. bidiagonal matrices. In a parallel environment direct solvers can take only restricted advantage of parallelism. Therefore, in this paper we develop a fast iterative solution method for sparse triangular matrices. In contrast to direct solvers for triangular matrices $L$ like graph-based methods, sparse factorization methods, or Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury, here we want to consider stationary Jacobi iterations. In its original form the Jacobi iteration for ill-conditioned matrices can lead to very slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce different acceleration tools like preconditioning (block Jacobi and Incomplete Sparse Approximate Inverse ISAI), and a recursive acceleration of the Jacobi method. Here the Neumann series is replaced by the Euler expansion (see [4, 19, 8]). This is derived by a recursive computation of the Neumann series using powers of the initial Jacobi iteration matrix. The goal is to shift the major part of the operations from cheap but numerous iteration steps to better parallelizable cheap and sparse matrix-matrix products reducing the number of necessary iterations considerably, e.g. to less than $\log_2(n)$ for an $n \times n$ matrix.},

However, it cannot meet the time and memory requirements for processing large-scale data. We have reinvestigated the classification accuracy and running efficiency of the algorithm for solving SMLR problems using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which is called fast SMLR (FSMLR) algorithm in this paper. By reformulating the optimization problem of FSMLR, we transform the serial convex optimization problem to the distributed convex optimization problem, i.e., global consensus problem and sharing problem. Based on the distributed optimization problem, we propose two distribute parallel SMLR algorithms, sample partitioning-based distributed SMLR (SP-SMLR), and feature partitioning-based distributed SMLR (FP-SMLR), for a large-scale sample and large-scale feature datasets in big data scenario, respectively. The experimental results show that the FSMLR algorithm has higher accuracy than the original SMLR algorithm. The big data experiments show that our distributed parallel SMLR algorithms can scale for massive samples and large-scale features, with high precision. In a word, our proposed serial and distribute SMLR algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract  = {Performance of single-machine, shared memory graph processing is affected by expensive atomic updates and poor cache locality. Data duplication, a popular approach to eliminate atomic updates by creating thread-local copies of shared data, incurs extreme memory overheads due to the large sizes of typical input graphs. Even memory-efficient duplication strategies that exploit the power-law structure common to many graphs (by duplicating only the highly-connected "hub" vertices) suffer from overheads for having to dynamically identify the hub vertices. Degree Sorting, a popular graph reordering technique that re-assigns hub vertices consecutive IDs in a bid to improve spatial locality, is effective for single-threaded graph applications but suffers from increased false sharing in parallel executions. \\
The main insight of this work is that the combination of data duplication and Degree Sorting eliminates the overheads of each optimization. Degree Sorting improves the efficiency of data duplication by assigning hub vertices consecutive IDs which enables easy identification of the hub vertices. Additionally, duplicating the hub vertex data eliminates false sharing in Degree Sorting since each thread updates its local copy of the hub vertex data. We evaluate this mutually-enabling combination of power-law-specific data duplication and Degree Sorting in a system called RADAR. RADAR improves performance by eliminating atomic updates for hub vertices and improving the cache locality of graph applications, providing speedups of up to 166x (1.88x on average) across different graph applications and input graphs.},

At the same time, memory operations are the primary energy consumer of modern architectures, heavily impacting the resource cost of large-scale applications and the battery life of mobile devices. This article tackles this mismatch between floating point arithmetic throughput and memory bandwidth by advocating a disruptive paradigm change with respect to how data are stored and processed in scientific applications. Concretely, the goal is to radically decouple the data storage format from the processing format and, ultimately, design a “modular precision ecosystem” that allows for more flexibility in terms of customized data access. For memory-bounded scientific applications, dynamically adapting the memory precision to the numerical requirements allows for attractive resource savings. In this article, we demonstrate the potential of employing a modular precision ecosystem for the block-Jacobi preconditioner and the PageRank algorithm -- two applications that are popular in the communities and at the same characteristic representatives for the field of numerical linear algebra and data analytics, respectively.}

To that purpose, iterative solvers are viewed as a promising alternative to direct methods on high-performance computers since, in theory, they are almost perfectly parallelizable. Their main drawback is the need of finding a suitable preconditioner to accelerate convergence. The factorized sparse approximate inverse (FSAI), mainly in its adaptive form, has proven to be an effective parallel preconditioner for several problems. In the present work, we report about two novel ideas to dynamically compute, on graphics processing units (GPUs), the FSAI sparsity pattern, which is the main task in its setup. The first approach, borrowed from the CPU implementation, uses a global array as a nonzero indicator, whereas the second one relies on a merge-sort procedure of multiple arrays. We will show that the second approach requires significantly less memory and overcomes issues related to the limited global memory available on GPUs. Numerical tests prove that the GPU implementation of FSAI allows for an average speed-up of 7.5 over a parallel CPU implementation. Moreover, we will show that the preconditioner computation is still feasible using single precision arithmetic with a further 20\% reduction of the setup cost. Finally, the strong scalability of the overall approach in shown in a multi-GPU setting.}

We describe the challenges and key properties of an implementation that can achieve perfect performance.

A code generation approach enables a simultaneously flexible and specialized implementation with autotuning.

Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) methods are widely used as preconditioners, because of their optimal computational cost and their algorithmic scalability. The wide availability of GPUs, now found in many of the fastest supercomputers, poses the problem of implementing efficiently these methods on high-throughput processors. In this work we focus on the application phase of AMG preconditioners, and in particular on the choice and implementation of smoothers and coarsest-level solvers capable of exploiting the computational power of clusters of GPUs. We consider block-Jacobi smoothers using sparse approximate inverses in the solve phase associated with the local blocks. The choice of approximate inverses instead of sparse matrix factorizations is driven by the large amount of parallelism exposed by the matrix-vector product as compared to the solution of large triangular systems on GPUs. The selected smoothers and solvers are implemented within the AMG preconditioning framework provided by the MLD2P4 library, using suitable sparse matrix data structures from the PSBLAS library. Their behaviour is illustrated in terms of execution speed and scalability, on a test case concerning groundwater modelling, provided by the Jülich Supercomputing Center within the Horizon 2020 Project EoCoE.}

Pipelined CG methods are designed to efficiently solve SPD linear systems on massively parallel distributed memory hardware, and typically display significantly improved strong scaling compared to classic CG. This increase in parallel performance is achieved by overlapping the global reduction phase (MPI_Iallreduce) required to compute the inner products in each iteration by (chiefly local) computational work such as the matrix-vector product as well as other global communication. This work includes a brief introduction to the deep pipelined CG method for readers that may be unfamiliar with the specifics of the method. A brief overview of implementation details provides the practical tools required for implementation of the algorithm. Subsequently, easily reproducible strong scaling results on the US Department of Energy (DoE) NERSC machine “Cori” (Phase I -- Haswell nodes) on up to 1024 nodes with 16 MPI ranks per node are presented using an implementation of $p(l)$-CG that is available in the open source PETSc library. Observations on the staggering and overlap of the asynchronous, non-blocking global communication phases with communication and computational kernels are drawn from the experiments.}

  annotation   = {Multilevel/multigrid methods is one of the most popular approaches for solving a large sparse linear system of equations, typically, arising from the discretization of partial differential equations. One critical step in the multilevel/multigrid methods is to form coarse matrices through a sequence of sparse matrix triple products. A commonly used approach for the triple products explicitly involves two steps, and during each step a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication is employed. This approach works well for many applications with a good computational efficiency, but it has a high memory overhead since some auxiliary matrices need to be temporarily stored for accomplishing the calculations. In this work, we propose two new algorithms that construct a coarse matrix with taking one pass through the input matrices without involving any auxiliary matrices for saving memory. The new approaches are referred to as “all-atonce” and “merged all-at-once” (a modified version of “all-at-once”) since the new algorithms calculate the two sparse matrix-matrix multiplications simultaneously, and the traditional method is denoted as “two-step”. The all-at-once and the merged all-at-once algorithms are implemented based on hash tables in PETSc as part of this work with a careful consideration on the performance in terms of the compute time and the memory usage. In the new methods, the first sparse matrix-matrix multiplication is implemented using a row-wise algorithm, and the second one is based on an outer product. We numerically show that the proposed algorithms and their implementations are perfectly scalable in both the compute time and the memory usage with up to 32,768 processor cores for a model problem with 27 billions of unknowns. The scalability is also demonstrated for a realistic neutron transport problem with over 2 billion unknowns on a supercomputer with 10,000 processor cores. Compared with the traditional two-step method, the all-at-once and the merged all-at-once algorithms consume much less memory for both the model problem and the realistic neutron transport problem meanwhile they are able to maintain the computational efficiency.},

It has enabled sophisticated performance analysis tool designers and performance-conscious scientists to gain insights into their applications by simply instrumenting their code using a handful of PAPI functions that “just work” across different hardware components. In the past, PAPI development had focused primarily on hardware-specific performance metrics. However, the rapidly increasing complexity of software infrastructure poses new measurement and analysis challenges for the developers of large-scale applications. In particular, acquiring information regarding the behavior of libraries and runtimes—used by scientific applications—requires low-level binary instrumentation, or APIs specific to each library and runtime. No uniform API for monitoring events that originate from inside the software stack has emerged. In this article, we present our efforts to extend PAPI's role so that it becomes the de facto standard for exposing performance-critical events, which we refer to as software-defined events (SDEs), from different software layers. Upgrading PAPI with SDEs enables monitoring of both types of performance events—hardware- and software-related events—in a uniform way, through the same consistent PAPI. The goal of this article is threefold. First, we motivate the need for SDEs and describe our design decisions regarding the functionality we offer through PAPI's new SDE interface. Second, we illustrate how SDEs can be utilized by different software packages, specifically, by showcasing their use in the numerical linear algebra library MAGMA-Sparse, the tensor algebra library TAMM that is part of the NWChem suite, and the compiler-based performance analysis tool Byfl. Third, we provide a performance analysis of the overhead that results from monitoring SDEs and discuss the trade-offs between overhead and functionality.}

Orthogonal NMF, which can further improve the locality of decomposition, has drawn considerable interest in clustering problems. However, imposing simultaneous non-negative and orthogonal structure can be difficult, and so existing algorithms can only solve it approximately. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative procedure called Greedy Orthogonal Pivoting Algorithm (GOPA). The GOPA method fully exploits the sparsity of non-negative orthogonal solutions to break the global problem into a series of local optimizations, in which an adaptive subset of coordinates are updated in a greedy, closed-form manner. The biggest advantage of GOPA is that it promotes exact orthogonality and provides solid empirical evidence that stronger orthogonality does contribute favorably to better clustering performance. On the other hand, we have designed randomized and batch-mode version of GOPA, which can further reduce the computational cost and improve accuracy, making it suitable for large data.}

This paper considers a new block decomposition algorithm that combines the effectiveness of combinatorial search methods and the efficiency of coordinate descent methods. Specifically, we consider a random strategy or/and a greedy strategy to select a subset of coordinates as the working set, and then perform a global combinatorial search over the working set based on the original objective function. We show that our method finds stronger stationary points than Amir Beck et al.'s coordinate-wise optimization method. In addition, we establish the global convergence and convergence rate of our block decomposition algorithm. Our experiments on solving sparse regularized and sparsity constrained least squares optimization problems demonstrate that our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance in terms of accuracy.},

It reduces the memory cost via minimizing the candidate cliques and representing them by the data structure bitset. It generates an appropriate order for the vertex set according to two optimized principles to reduce the CPU cost. We further design a partition-based CMC-bit algorithm with a one-side extending strategy to solve the memory-limited problem. We parallelize the CMC-bit algorithm based on MapReduce with a range-based partition strategy to make an optimal trade-off between the shuffling workload of graph decomposition and load balance in the Reduce phase. We conduct extensive experiments on 30 real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that both the CMC-bit algorithm and its parallel implementation significantly outperform the respective state-of-the-art algorithms in speed. We also show that the parallel CMC-bit algorithm achieves good performance on the scalability with respect to both the reducer number and the CPU number.},

The first is bLARS, a block version of LARS algorithm, where we update b columns at each iteration. Assuming that the data are row-partitioned, bLARS reduces the number of arithmetic operations, latency, and bandwidth by a factor of b. The second is Tournament-bLARS (T-bLARS), a tournament version of LARS, in which case processors compete, by running several LARS computations in parallel, to choose b new columns to be added into the solution. Assuming that the data are column-partitioned, T-bLARS reduces latency by a factor of b. Similarly to LARS, our proposed methods generate a sequence of linear models.

Much of the benefits of chip specialization stems from optimizing a computational problem within a given chip's transistor budget. Unfortunately, the stagnation of the number of transistors available on a chip will limit the accelerator design optimization space, leading to diminishing specialization returns, ultimately hitting an accelerator wall.\\ In this work, we tackle the question of what are the limits of future accelerators and chip specialization? We do this by characterizing how current accelerators depend on CMOS scaling, based on a physical modeling tool that we constructed using datasheets of thousands of chips. We identify key concepts used in chip specialization, and explore case studies to understand how specialization has progressed over time in different applications and chip platforms (e.g., GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs). Utilizing these insights, we build a model which projects forward to see what future gains can and cannot be enabled from chip specialization. A quantitative analysis of specialization returns and technological boundaries is critical to help researchers understand the limits of accelerators and develop methods to surmount them.},

  abstract     = {To realize large-scale or high-resolution structural topology optimization design, a fully parallel parameterized level set method with compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs) is developed based on both the uniform and non-uniform structured meshes. In this work, the whole computation process is parallelized, including mesh generation, sensitivity analysis, calculation and assembly of the element stiffness matrices, solving of the structural state equation, parameterization and updating of the level set function, and output of the computational results during the optimization iterations. In addition, some typical numerical examples, in which the calculation scale is up to 7 million 8-node hexahedral elements, are carried out for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the computing time is also analyzed in detail. It is found that: (1) In the optimized structures, the thin sheet-like components gradually replace the truss-like ones when refining the mesh, (2) the parameterization process of the level set function will become fast as long as the non-uniformity of mesh is not very high and the supported radius of CSRBF is small enough, and (3) more than 80\% of the total computing time is always consumed for solving the structural state equation during the finite element analysis (FEA).},

  abstract     = {The efficient development of system software and design applications in parallel architecture is a notable challenge considering various aspects, such as load balancing, memory spaces, communication, and synchronization. This paper presents a block parallel Cholesky factorization algorithm for a multicore system, which is developed based on activity on edge network. First, the basic block computing tasks and their dependencies are taken as vertices and edges, respectively, and a directed acyclic graph corresponding to the specific block parallel Cholesky factorization is generated. Next, each edge of the directed acyclic graph is assigned to a weight equal to the processing time of the initial vertex of the edge, and the directed acyclic graph becomes an activity on edge network with only one starting and one ending vertex. Finally, a queuing algorithm is designed for the basic block computing tasks according to the edge activity on edge network, and a dynamic scheduling strategy is developed for block parallel Cholesky factorization. The results of the experiments concerning the parallel execution time of the algorithm in multicore systems with different configurations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has notable advantages compared with the traditional static scheduling algorithm, and it exhibits satisfactory load balancing, parallelism, and scalability capacities.},

We compare the performance of GraFBoost with 1 GB of DRAM against various state-of-the-art graph analytics software including FlashGraph, running on a 32-thread Xeon server with 128 GB of DRAM. We demonstrate that despite the relatively small amount of DRAM, GraFBoost achieves high performance with very large graphs no other system can handle, and rivals the performance of the fastest software platforms on sizes of graphs that existing platforms can handle. Unlike in-memory and semi-external systems, GraFBoost uses a constant amount of memory for all problems, and its performance decreases very slowly as graph sizes increase, allowing GraFBoost to scale to much larger problems than possible with existing systems while using much less resources on a single-node system. The key component of GraFBoost is the sort-reduce accelerator, which implements a novel method to sequentialize fine-grained random accesses to flash storage. The sort-reduce accelerator logs random update requests and then uses hardware-accelerated external sorting with interleaved reduction functions. GraFBoost also stores newly updated vertex values generated in each superstep of the algorithm lazily with the old vertex values to further reduce I/O traffic. We evaluate the performance of GraFBoost for PageRank, breadth-first search and betweenness centrality on our FPGA-based prototype (Xilinx VC707 with 1 GB DRAM and 1 TB flash) and compare it to other graph processing systems including a pure software implementation of GrapFBoost.},

Sparse computations incorporate indirect memory accesses such as x[col[j]] whose memory locations cannot be determined until runtime. The key contributions of this paper are two compile-time techniques for significantly reducing the overhead of runtime dependence testing: (1) identifying new equality constraints that result in more efficient runtime inspectors, and (2) identifying subset relations between dependence constraints such that one dependence test subsumes another one that is therefore eliminated. New equality constraints discovery is enabled by taking advantage of domain-specific knowledge about index arrays, such as col[j]. These simplifications lead to automatically-generated inspectors that make it practical to parallelize such computations. We analyze our simplification methods for a collection of seven sparse computations. The evaluation shows our methods reduce the complexity of the runtime inspectors significantly. Experimental results for a collection of five large matrices show parallel speedups ranging from 2x to more than 8x running on a 8-core CPU.},

We employ this framework for the Ginkgo software ecosystem, but the framework can be used with essentially any software project, including the comparison between different software libraries. The Continuous Integration (CI) framework of Ginkgo is also extended to automatically run a benchmark suite on predetermined HPC systems, store the state of the machine and the environment along with the compiled binaries, and collect results in a publicly accessible performance data repository based on Git. The Ginkgo performance explorer (GPE) can be used to retrieve the performance data from the repository, and visualizes it in a web browser. GPE also implements an interface that allows users to write scripts, archived in a Git repository, to extract particular data, compute particular metrics, and visualize them in many different formats (as specified by the script). The combination of these approaches creates a workflow which enables performance reproducibility and software sustainability of scientific software. In this paper, we present example scripts that extract and visualize performance data for Ginkgo's SpMV kernels that allow users to identify the optimal kernel for specific problem characteristics.},

Although several SpGEMM algorithms have been proposed, almost all of them are restricted to the compressed sparse row (CSR) format, and the possible performance gain from exploiting other formats has not been well studied. The particular format and algorithm that yield the best performance for SpGEMM also remain undetermined.\\ In this work, we conduct a prospective study on format-specific parallel SpGEMM algorithms, and analyze their pros and cons. We then propose IA-SpGEMM, an input-aware auto-tuning Framework for SpGEMM, that provides a unified programming interface in the CSR format and automatically determines the best format and algorithm for arbitrary sparse matrices. For this purpose, we set-up an algorithm set and design a deep learning model called MatNet that is trained by over 2,700 matrices from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection to quickly and accurately predict the best solution by using sparse features and density representations. We evaluate our framework on CPUs and a GPU, and the results show that IA-SpGEMM is on average 3.27$\times$ and 13.17$\times$ faster than MKL on an Intel and an AMD platform, respectively, and is 2.23$\times$ faster than cuSPARSE on an NVIDIA GPU.},

  abstract   = {There has been a rise in the popularity of algebraic methods for graph algorithms given the development of the GraphBLAS library and other sparse matrix methods. These are useful in practice because many graph algorithms are amenable to sparse matrix multiplication. An exemplar for these approaches is Breadth-First Search (BFS). The algebraic BFS algorithm is simply a recursion of matrix-vector multiplications with the $n \times n$ adjacency matrix. Despite many redundant operations over nonzeros that ultimately lead to suboptimal performance, the algebraic BFS is appealing for practical implementations because it is simple and embarrassingly parallel. By using highly tuned matrix libraries it can be faster in practice than the theoretically optimal combinatorial algorithm. Therefore an optimal algebraic BFS should be of keen interest especially if it is easily integrated with existing matrix methods.\\ Current methods, notably in the GraphBLAS, use a Sparse Matrix Sparse Vector (SpMSpV) multiplication in which the input vector is kept in a sparse representation in each step of the BFS. But simply applying SpMSpV in BFS does not lead to optimal runtime. Each nonzero in the vector must be masked in subsequent steps. This has been an area of recent recent in GraphBLAS and other libraries. While in theory these masking methods are asymptotically optimal on sparse graphs, many add work that leads to suboptimal runtime. We give a new optimal, algebraic BFS for sparse graphs that is also a constant factor faster than theoretically optimal SpMSpV methods. We show how to eliminate redundant operations so an element in the adjacency matrix is operated upon no more than once, thus taking $O(m)$ operations for a graph with $O(m)$ edges.\\ Our method multiplies progressively smaller submatrices of the adjacency matrix at each step. The matrix remains unchanged, rather we are masking the rows and columns in the matrix that corresponds to previously visited vertices. The input vector in each step is also effectively masked so it is a sparse vector. Thus our method multiplies a sparse submatrix by a sparse vector in decreasing size each step. Our sequential algebraic BFS algorithm takes $O(m)$ algebraic operations on a sparse graph as opposed to $O(mn)$ operations of other sparse matrix approaches. Our analysis closes a gap in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We propose a new algorithm to improve the strong scalability of right-looking sparse LU factorization on distributed memory systems. Our 3D algorithm for sparse LU uses a three-dimensional MPI process grid, exploits elimination tree parallelism, and trades off increased memory for reduced per-process communication. We also analyze the asymptotic improvements for planar graphs (e.g., those arising from 2D grid or mesh discretizations) and certain non-planar graphs (specifically for 3D grids and meshes). For a planar graph with n vertices, our algorithm reduces communication volume asymptotically in n by a factor of Ologn and latency by a factor of Ologn. For non-planar cases, our algorithm can reduce the per-process communication volume by 3$\times$ and latency by On13 times. In all cases, the memory needed to achieve these gains is a constant factor. We implemented our algorithm by extending the 2D data structure used in SuperLU_DIST. Our new 3D code achieves empirical speedups up to 27$\times$ for planar graphs and up to 3.3$\times$ for non-planar graphs over the baseline 2D SuperLU_DIST when run on 24,000 cores of a Cray XC30. We extend the 3D algorithm for heterogeneous architectures by adding the Highly Asynchronous Lazy Offload (Halo) algorithm for co-processor offload [44]. On 4096 nodes of a Cray XK7 with 32,768 CPU cores and 4096 Nvidia K20x GPUs, the 3D algorithm achieves empirical speedups up to 24$\times$ for planar graphs and 3.5$\times$ for non-planar graphs over the baseline 2D SuperLU_DIST with co-processor acceleration.},

General-purpose compression struggles to achieve both good compression ratios and fast decompression for block-wise uncompressed operations. Therefore, we introduce Compressed Linear Algebra (CLA) for lossless matrix compression. CLA encodes matrices with lightweight, value-based compression techniques and executes linear algebra operations directly on the compressed representations. We contribute effective column compression schemes, cache-conscious operations, and an efficient sampling-based compression algorithm. Our experiments show good compression ratios and operations performance close to the uncompressed case, which enables fitting larger datasets into available memory.

  abstract     = {The solution of large sparse linear systems is one of the most time consuming kernels in many numerical simulations. The domain decomposition community has developed many efficient and robust methods in the last decades. While many of these solvers fall into the abstract Schwarz (aS) framework, their robustness has originally been demonstrated on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we propose a bound for the condition number of all deflated aS methods provided that the coarse grid consists of the assembly of local components that contain the kernel of some local operators. We show that classical results from the literature on particular instances of aS methods can be retrieved from this bound. We then show that such a coarse grid correction can be explicitly obtained algebraically via generalized eigenproblems, leading to a condition number independent of the number of domains. This result can be readily applied to retrieve or improve the bounds previously obtained via generalized eigenproblems in the particular cases of Neumann-Neumann (NN), Additive Schwarz (AS) and optimized Robin but also generalizes them when applied with approximate local solvers. Interestingly, the proposed methodology turns out to be a comparison of the considered particular aS method with generalized versions of both NN and AS for tackling the lower and upper part of the spectrum, respectively. We furthermore show that the application of the considered grid corrections in an additive fashion is robust in the AS case although it is not robust for aS methods in general. In particular, the proposed framework allows for ensuring the robustness of the AS method applied on the Schur complement (AS/S), either with deflation or additively, and with the freedom of relying on an approximate local Schur complement. Numerical experiments illustrate these statements.},

  abstract    = {We consider the numerical method for fractional diffusion problems which is based on an extension to a mixed boundary value problem for a local operator in a higher dimensional space. We observe that, when this problem is discretized using tensor product spaces as is commonly done, the solution can be very well approximated by low-rank tensors. This motivates us to apply iterative low-rank approximation algorithms in order to efficiently solve this extended problem. In particular, we employ a recently proposed greedy Tucker approximation method as well as a more classical greedy rank one update method. Throughout, all objects of interest are kept in suitable low-rank approximations, which dramatically reduces the required amount of memory compared to the full formulation of the extended problem.\\
Our approach can be used for general, non-structured space discretizations. If the space discretization itself has tensor product structure, we can further decompose the problem in order to deal with even lower dimensional objects. We also note that the approach can be directly applied to higher-order discretizations both in space and the extended variable.\\
In several numerical examples, we demonstrate the convergence behaviour of the proposed methods. In particular, the Tucker approximation approach requires only a few iterations in order to reach the discretization error in all tested settings.},

  abstract     = {State-of-the-art Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has superior performances on float-pointing calculation and memory bandwidth, and therefore has great potential in many computationally intensive power system applications, one of which is the inversion of large-scale sparse matrix. It is a fundamental component for many power system analyses which requires to solve massive number of forward and backward substitution (F\&B) subtasks and seems to be a good GPU-accelerated candidate application. By means of solving multiple F\&B subtasks concurrently and a serial of performance tunings in compliance with GPU's architectures, we successfully develop a batch F\&B algorithm on GPUs, which not only extracts the intra-level and intra-level parallelisms inside single F\&B subtask but also explores a more regular parallelism among massive F\&B subtasks, called inter-task parallelism. Case study on a 9241-dimension case shows that the proposed batch F\&B solver consumes 2.92 $\mu$s per forward substitution (FS) subtask when the batch size is equal to 3072, achieving 65 times speedup relative to KLU library. And on the basis the complete design process of GPU-based inversion algorithm is proposed. By offloading the tremendous computational burden to GPU, the inversion of 9241-dimension case consumes only 97 ms, which can achieve 8.1 times speedup relative to the 12-core CPU inversion solver based on KLU library. The proposed batch F\&B solver is practically very promising in many other power system applications requiring solving massive F\&B subtasks, such as probabilistic power flow analysis.},

SpMV is one of core algorithms in many high-performance computing applications. This paper implements a fine-grained design for generic parallel SpMV based on the special Sunway architecture and finds three main performance limitations, i.e., storage limitation, load imbalance, and huge overhead of irregular memory accesses. To address these problems, this paper introduces a customized and accelerative framework for SpMV (CASpMV) on the Sunway. The CASpMV customizes an auto-tuning four-way partition scheme for SpMV based on the proposed statistical model, which describes the sparse matrix structure characteristics, to make it better fit in with the computing architecture and memory hierarchy of the Sunway. Moreover, the CASpMV provides an accelerative method and customized optimizations to avoid irregular memory accesses and further improve its performance on the Sunway. Our CASpMV achieves a performance improvement that ranges from 588.05\% to 2118.62\% over the generic parallel SpMV on a CG (which corresponds to an MPI process) of the Sunway on average and has good scalability on multiple CGs. The performance comparisons of the CASpMV with state-of-the-art methods on the Sunway indicate that the sparsity and irregularity of data structures have less impact on CASpMV.},

  abstract     = {High performance implementation of matrix multiplication is essential for scientific computing. The memory access procedure is quite possible to be the bottleneck of matrix multiplication. The widely used GotoBLAS GEMM implementation divides the integral matrix into several partitions to be assigned to different cores for parallelization. Traditionally, each core deploys a DMA transfer to access its own partition in the DRAM memory. However, deploying an independent DMA transfer for each core cannot efficiently exploit the inter-core locality. Also, multiple concurrent DMA transfers interfere with each other, further reducing the DRAM access efficiency. We observe that the same row of neighboring partitions is in the same DRAM page, which means that there is significant locality inherent in the address layout. We propose the coordinated DMA to efficiently exploit the locality. It invokes one transfer to serve all cores and moves data in a row-major manner to improve the DRAM access efficiency. Compared with a baseline design, the coordinated DMA improves the bandwidth by 84.8\% and reduces DRAM energy consumption by 43.1\% for micro-benchmarks. It achieves higher performance for the GEMM and Linpack benchmark. With much less hardware costs, the coordinated DMA significantly outperforms an out-of-order memory controller.},

The BFS-MCS method is a Breadth First Search (BFS)-like heuristic approach based on the maximum cardinality search family; Lexi-Order is an extension of doubly lexical ordering of matrices to tensors. We show the effects of these schemes within the context of a widely used tensor computation, the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD), when storing the tensor in three previously proposed sparse tensor formats: coordinate (COO), compressed sparse fiber (CSF), and hierarchical coordinate (HiCOO). A new partition-based superblock scheduling is also proposed for HiCOO format to improve load balance. On modern multicore CPUs, we show Lexi-Order obtains up to 4.14$\times$ speedup on sequential HiCOO-Mttkrp and 11.88$\times$ speedup on its parallel counterpart. The performance of COO- and CSF-based Mttkrps also improves. Our two reordering methods are more effective than state-of-the-art approaches.

We present analytical models to understand the communication cost of our algorithm and show that our 3D sparse triangular solver can reduce the per-process communication volume asymptotically by a factor of $O(n^{1/4})$ and $O(n^{1/6})$ for problems arising from the finite element discretizations of 2D "planar" and 3D "non-planar" PDEs, respectively.

The numerical methods for solving linear equations can be categorised into direct methods and iterative methods. Jacobi method is one of the iterative solvers that has been widely used due to its simplicity and efficiency. Its performance is affected by factors including the storage format, the specific computational algorithm, and its implementation. While the performance of Jacobi has been studied extensively on conventional CPU architectures, research on its performance on emerging architectures, such as the Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture, is still in its infancy. In this chapter, we investigate the performance of parallel implementations of the Jacobi method on Knights Corner (KNC), the first generation of the Intel MIC architectures. We implement Jacobi with two storage formats, Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) and Modified Sparse Row (MSR), and measure their performance in terms of execution time, offloading time, and speedup. We report results of sparse matrices with over 28 million rows and 640 million non-zero elements acquired from 13 diverse application domains. The experimental results show that our Jacobi parallel implementation on MIC achieves speedups of up to 27.75$\times$ compared to the sequential implementation. It also delivers a speedup of up to 3.81$\times$ compared to a powerful node comprising 24 cores in two Intel Xeon E5-2695v2 processors.}

However, such an evaluation does not provide a deeper insight nor allow to compare new SpMV techniques with their competitors directly. In this chapter, we explain the notable performance characteristics of the GPU architectures and SpMV computations. We discuss various strategies to improve the performance of SpMV on GPUs.

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have reached an outstanding accuracy in the past years, often going beyond human abilities. Nowadays, DNNs are widely used in many Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as computer vision, natural language processing and autonomous driving. However, these incredible performance come at a high computational cost, requiring complex hardware platforms. Therefore, the need for dedicated hardware accelerators able to drastically speed up the execution by preserving a low-power attitude arise. This paper presents innovative techniques able to tackle matrix sparsity in convolutional DNNs due to non-linear activation functions. Developed architectures allow to skip unnecessary operations, like zero multiplications, without sacrificing accuracy or throughput and improving the energy efficiency. Such improvement could enhance the performance of embedded limited-budget battery applications, where cost-effective hardware, accuracy and duration are critical to expanding the deployment of AI.}

Various methods have been proposed to address this issue and obtain linear scaling $O(M)$. One promising formulation is the direct minimization of energy. Such methods take advantage of physical localization of the solution, namely that the solution can be sought in terms of non-orthogonal orbitals with local support. In this work a numerically efficient implementation of sparse parallel vectors within the open-source finite element library deal.II is proposed. The main algorithmic ingredient is the matrix-free evaluation of the Hamiltonian operator by cell-wise quadrature. Based on an a-priori chosen support for each vector we develop algorithms and data structures to perform (i) matrix-free sparse matrix multivector products (SpMM), (ii) the projection of an operator onto a sparse sub-space (inner products), and (iii) post-multiplication of a sparse multivector with a square matrix. The node-level performance is analyzed using a roofline model. Our matrix-free implementation of finite element operators with sparse multivectors achieves the performance of 157 GFlop/s on Intel Cascade Lake architecture.

Coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF) is an important tool for this purpose. Designing an accurate and efficient CMTF method has become more crucial as the size and dimension of real-world data are growing explosively. However, existing methods for CMTF suffer from lack of accuracy, slow running time, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose S3CMTF, a fast, accurate, and scalable CMTF method. In contrast to previous methods which do not handle large sparse tensors and are not parallelizable, S3CMTF provides parallel sparse CMTF by carefully deriving gradient update rules. S3CMTF asynchronously updates partial gradients without expensive locking. We show that our method is guaranteed to converge to a quality solution theoretically and empirically. S3CMTF further boosts the performance by carefully storing intermediate computation and reusing them. We theoretically and empirically show that S3CMTF is the fastest, outperforming existing methods. Experimental results show that S3CMTF is up to 930$\times$ faster than existing methods while providing the best accuracy. S3CMTF shows linear scalability on the number of data entries and the number of cores. In addition, we apply S3CMTF to Yelp rating tensor data coupled with 3 additional matrices to discover interesting patterns.}

  abstract   = {When solving linear systems arising from PDE discretizations, iterative methods (such as Conjugate Gradient, GMRES, or MINRES) are often the only practical choice. To converge in a small number of iterations, however, they have to be coupled with an efficient preconditioner. The efficiency of the preconditioner depends largely on its accuracy on the eigenvectors corresponding to small eigenvalues, and unfortunately, black-box methods typically cannot guarantee sufficient accuracy on these eigenvectors. Thus, constructing the preconditioner becomes a very problemdependent task. We describe a hierarchical approximate factorization approach which addresses this issue by focusing on improving the accuracy on smooth eigenvectors (such eigenvectors typically correspond to the small eigenvalues). The improved accuracy is achieved by preserving the action of the factorized matrix on piecewise polynomial functions of the PDE domain. Based on the factorization, we propose a family of sparse preconditioners with $O (n)$ or $O (n log n)$ construction complexities. Our methods exhibit the optimal $O (n)$ solution times in benchmarks run on large elliptic problems of different types, arising for example in flow or mechanical simulations. In the case of the linear elasticity equation the preconditioners are exact on the near-kernel rigid body modes.}

  abstract    = {High-performance implementations of graph algorithms are challenging to implement on new parallel hardware such as GPUs, because of three challenges: (1) difficulty of coming up with graph building blocks, (2) load imbalance on parallel hardware, and (3) graph problems having low arithmetic ratio. To address these challenges, GraphBLAS is an innovative, on-going effort by the graph analytics community to propose building blocks based in sparse linear algebra, which will allow graph algorithms to be expressed in a performant, succinct, composable and portable manner. Initial research efforts in implementing GraphBLAS on GPUs has been promising, but performance still trails by an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art graph frameworks using the traditional graph-centric approach of describing operations on vertices or edges.\\ This dissertation examines the performance challenges of a linear algebra-based approach to building graph frameworks and describes new design principles for overcoming these bottlenecks. Among the new design principles is making exploiting input sparsity a first-class citizen in the framework. This is an especially important optimization, because it allows users to write graph algorithms without specifying certain implementation details thus permitting the software backend to choose the optimal implementation based on the input sparsity. Exploiting output sparsity allows users to tell the backend which values of the output in a single vectorized computation they do not want computed. We examine when it is profitable to exploit this output sparsity to reduce computational complexity. Load-balancing is an important feature for balancing work amongst parallel workers. We describe the important load-balancing features for handling graphs with different characteristics.\\ The design principles described in the thesis have been implemented in GraphBLAST, an open-source high-performance graph framework on GPU developed as part of this dissertation. It is notable for being the first graph framework based in linear algebra to get comparable or faster performance compared to the traditional, vertex-centric backends. The benefits of design principles described in this thesis have been shown to be important for single GPU, and it will grow in importance when it serves as a building block for distributed implementation in the future and as a single GPU backend for higher-level languages such as Python. A graph framework based in linear algebra not only improves performance of existing graph algorithms, but in quickly prototyping new algorithms as well.}

When moving from PCA to sPCA, there are a number of implications that the practitioner needs to be aware of. A relevant one is that scores and loadings in sPCA may not be orthogonal. For this reason, the traditional way of computing scores, residuals and variance explained that is used in the classical PCA cannot directly be applied to sPCA models. This also affects how sPCA components should be visualized. In this paper we illustrate this problem both theoretically and numerically using simulations for several state-ofthe-art sPCA algorithms, and provide proper computation of the different elements mentioned. We show that sPCA approaches present disparate and limited performance when modeling noisefree, sparse data. In a follow-up paper, we discuss the theoretical properties that lead to this problem.}

By exploiting the repetitive nature of online optimization, we are able to greatly speedup the solution time. Our approach encodes the optimal solution into a small amount of information denoted as strategy using the Voice of Optimization framework proposed in [BS18]. In this way the core part of the optimization algorithm becomes a multiclass classification problem which can be solved very quickly. In this work we extend that framework to real-time and high-speed applications focusing on parametric mixed-integer quadratic optimization (MIQO). We propose an extremely fast online optimization algorithm consisting of a feedforward neural network (NN) evaluation and a linear system solution where the matrix has already been factorized. Therefore, this online approach does not require any solver nor iterative algorithm. We show the speed of the proposed method both in terms of total computations required and measured execution time. We estimate the number of floating point operations (flops) required to completely recover the optimal solution as a function of the problem dimensions. Compared to state-of-the-art MIO routines, the online running time of our method is very predictable and can be lower than a single matrix factorization time. We benchmark our method against the state-ofthe-art solver Gurobi obtaining from two to three orders of magnitude speedups on benchmarks with real-world data.},

  abstract   = {The symmetric sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SymmSpMV) is an important building block for many numerical linear algebra kernel operations or graph traversal applications. Parallelizing SymmSpMV on today's multicore platforms with up to 100 cores is difficult due to the need to manage conflicting updates on the result vector. Coloring approaches can be used to solve this problem without data duplication, but existing coloring algorithms do not take load balancing and deep memory hierarchies into account, hampering scalability and full-chip performance. In this work, we propose the recursive algebraic coloring engine (RACE), a novel coloring algorithm and open-source library implementation, which eliminates the shortcomings of previous coloring methods in terms of hardware efficiency and parallelization overhead. We describe the level construction, distance-k coloring, and load balancing steps in RACE, use it to parallelize SymmSpMV, and compare its performance on 31 sparse matrices with other state-of-the-art coloring techniques and Intel MKL on two modern multicore processors. RACE outperforms all other approaches substantially and behaves in accordance with the roofline model. Outliers are discussed and analyzed in detail. While we focus on SymmSpMV in this paper, our algorithm and software is applicable to any sparse matrix operation with data dependencies that can be resolved by distance-k coloring.}

  abstract    = {Linear algebra is the foundation of machine learning, especially for handling big data. We want to extract useful information that can represent the behavior of the data. For data with underlying known structures, it is straightforward to apply algorithms that maintain that structure. For instance, singular value decomposition (SVD) is one way to approximate lowrank matrices. The generalized SVD, tensor decomposition, is the crux of model estimation for tensors. However, not all data has a trivial structure. Multi-modality data that contains information from different sources can be complex and hard to extract the structure. A data-independent randomized algorithm, such as sketching, is the solution for this case. Under both scenarios, the information extraction process may be statistically challenging as the problems are non-convex optimization problems. More importantly, the large size and the high-dimensionality of the data have been significant obstacles in discovering hidden variables and summarizing them. Thus, how to improve high-dimensional data computation efficiency is vitally important.\\ This thesis contains the theoretical analysis for learning the underlying information from high-dimensional structured or non-structured data via tensor operations such as tensor decomposition and tensor sketching. It is easy to consider tensors as multi-dimensional vectors or matrices and apply vector/matrix-based algorithms to find the solution. However, these methods omit multi-dimensionality of the data and can be computational inefficient than considering the tensor as a whole. We show the superiority of our approximation algorithms over these methods from computation and memory efficiency point of views.\\ This thesis also discusses optimizing tensor operation computations from the high-performance computing aspect. Conventional methods treat tensors as flattened matrices or vectors. Operations between tensors may require lots of permutations and reshapes. We propose new tensor algebra computation routines that avoid the prepossessing as much as possible. The value of this approach and its applications are recognized by NVIDIA. The proposed interface exists in the CUBLAS 8.0.}

  title       = {Bridging the Gap Between H-Matrices and Sparse Direct Methods for the Solution of Large Linear Systems},
  abstract    = {Many physical phenomena may be studied through modeling and numerical simulations, commonplace in scientific applications. To be tractable on a computer, appropriated discretization techniques must be considered, which often lead to a set of linear equations whose features depend on the discretization techniques. Among them, the Finite Element Method usually leads to sparse linear systems whereas the Boundary Element Method leads to dense linear systems. The size of the resulting linear systems depends on the domain where the studied physical phenomenon develops and tends to become larger and larger as the performance of the computer facilities increases. For the sake of numerical robustness, the solution techniques based on the factorization of the matrix associated with the linear system are the methods of choice when affordable. In that respect, hierarchical methods based on low-rank compression have allowed a drastic reduction of the computational requirements for the solution of dense linear systems over the last two decades. For sparse linear systems, their application remains a challenge which has been studied by both the community of hierarchical matrices and the community of sparse matrices. On the one hand, the first step taken by the community of hierarchical matrices most often takes advantage of the sparsity of the problem through the use of nested dissection. While this approach benefits from the hierarchical structure, it is not, however, as efficient as sparse solvers regarding the exploitation of zeros and the structural separation of zeros from non-zeros. On the other hand, sparse factorization is organized so as to lead to a sequence of smaller dense operations, enticing sparse solvers to use this property and exploit compression techniques from hierarchical methods in order to reduce the computational cost of these elementary operations. Nonetheless, the globally hierarchical structure may be lost if the compression of hierarchical methods is used only locally on dense submatrices. We here review the main techniques that have been employed by both those communities, trying to highlight their common properties and their respective limits with a special emphasis on studies that have aimed to bridge the gap between them. With these observations in mind, we propose a class of hierarchical algorithms based on the symbolic analysis of the structure of the factors of a sparse matrix. These algorithms rely on a symbolic information to cluster and construct a hierarchical structure coherent with the non-zero pattern of the matrix. Moreover, the resulting hierarchical matrix relies on low-rank compression for the reduction of the memory consumption of large submatrices as well as the time to solution of the solver. We also compare multiple ordering techniques based on geometrical or topological properties. Finally, we open the discussion to a coupling between the Finite Element Method and the Boundary Element Method in a unified computational framework.}

  abstract   = {Generalized Linear Models (GLM) form a wide class of regression and classification models, where prediction is a function of a linear combination of the input variables. For statistical inference in high dimension, sparsity inducing regularizations have proven to be useful while offering statistical guarantees. However, solving the resulting optimization problems can be challenging: even for popular iterative algorithms such as coordinate descent, one needs to loop over a large number of variables. To mitigate this, techniques known as screening rules and working sets diminish the size of the optimization problem at hand, either by progressively removing variables, or by solving a growing sequence of smaller problems. For both techniques, significant variables are identified thanks to convex duality arguments. In this paper, we show that the dual iterates of a GLM exhibit a Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) behavior after sign identification, when the primal problem is solved with proximal gradient descent or cyclic coordinate descent. Exploiting this regularity, one can construct dual points that offer tighter certificates of optimality, enhancing the performance of screening rules and helping to design competitive working set algorithms.}

In this work, we mainly consider maximal matching and maximal independent set problems in the MPC model.\\
  These problems are known to admit efficient MPC algorithms if the space available per machine is near-linear in the number n of nodes. This is not only often significantly more than what we can afford, but also allows for easy if not trivial solutions for sparse graphs -- which are common in real-world large-scale graphs. We are, therefore, interested in the low-memory MPC model, where the space per machine is restricted to be strongly sublinear, that is, $n^\delta$ for any constant $0 < \delta < 1$. \\
  We parametrize our algorithms by the arboricity $\lambda$ of the input graph. Our key ingredient is a degree reduction technique that reduces these problems in graphs with arboricity $\lambda$ to the corresponding problems in graphs with maximum degree $poly(\lambda, log n)$ in $O(log^2 log n)$ rounds, giving rise to $O(\sqrt{log \lambda} \cdot log log \lambda + log 2 log n)$-round algorithms.\\
  Our result is particularly interesting for graphs with $poly log n$ arboricity as for such graphs, we get $O(log^2 log n)$-round algorithms. This covers most natural families of sparse graphs and almost exponentially improves over previous algorithms that all required log $O(1)$ n rounds in this regime of MPC.\\
  Finally, our maximal matching algorithm can be employed to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate maximum cardinality matching, a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate maximum weighted matching, as well as a 2-approximate minimum vertex cover in essentially the same number of rounds.},

This settles the asymptotic complexity of this problem. It moreover improves upon the $O(log^\star \Delta)$-round randomized algorithms of Parter and Su [DISC'18] and $O((log log \Delta) \cdot log^\star \Delta)$-round randomized algorithm of Parter [ICALP'18].\\ Massively Parallel Computation: We present a randomized $(\Delta + 1)$-list-coloring algorithm with round complexity $O(\sqrt{log log n})$ in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model with strongly sublinear memory per machine. This algorithm uses a memory of $O(n\alpha)$ per machine, for any desirable constant $\alpha > 0$, and a total memory of $\tilde{O} (m)$, where m is the number of edges in the graph. Notably, this is the first coloring algorithm with sublogarithmic round complexity, in the sublinear memory regime of MPC. For the quasilinear memory regime of MPC, an $O(1)$-round algorithm was given very recently by Assadi et al. [SODA'19].\\ Centralized Local Computation: We show that $(\Delta + 1)$-list-coloring can be solved by a randomized algorithm with query complexity $\Delta O(1) \dots O(log n)$, in the centralized local computation model. The previous state of the art for $(\Delta+1)$-list-coloring in the centralized local computation model are based on simulation of known LOCAL algorithms.

However, the design and development of an efficient parallel algorithm for the transport criticality calculations is a challenging task especially when the number of processor cores is large and the unstructured mesh is adopted since both the compute time and the memory usage need to be taken into consideration. In this paper, we study a monolithic multilevel Schwarz preconditioner for the transport criticality calculations using the nonlinear diffusion acceleration (NDA). In NDA, the linear systems of equations arising from the discretizations of the nonlinear diffusion equations and the transport equations need to be efficiently solved. To achieve this goal, we propose a monolithically coupled approach equipped with several important ingredients; e.g., subspace-based coarsening, aggressive coarsening and strength matrix thresholding. The proposed monolithic multilevel method is capable of efficiently handling the linear systems of equations for both the transport system and the diffusion system. In the multilevel method, the construction of coarse spaces is nontrivial and expensive. We propose a subspace-based coarsening algorithm to resolve this issue by exploring the matrix structures of the transport equations and the nonlinear diffusion equations. We numerically demonstrate that the monolithic multilevel preconditioner with the subspace-based coarsening algorithm is twice as fast as that equipped with a full space based coarsening approach on thousands of processor cores for an unstructured mesh neutron transport problem with billions of unknowns.},

  abstract    = {High-performance implementations of graph algorithms are challenging to implement on new parallel hardware such as GPUs, because of three challenges: (1) difficulty of coming up with graph building blocks, (2) load imbalance on parallel hardware, and (3) graph problems having low arithmetic intensity. To address these challenges, GraphBLAS is an innovative, on-going effort by the graph analytics community to propose building blocks based in sparse linear algebra, which will allow graph algorithms to be expressed in a performant, succinct, composable and portable manner. In this paper, we examine the performance challenges of a linear algebra-based approach to building graph frameworks and describe new design principles for overcoming these bottlenecks. Among the new design principles is exploiting input sparsity, which allows users to write graph algorithms without specifying push and pull direction. Exploiting output sparsity allows users to tell the backend which values of the output in a single vectorized computation they do not want computed. Load-balancing is an important feature for balancing work amongst parallel workers. We describe the important load-balancing features for handling graphs with different characteristics. The design principles described in this paper have been implemented in "GraphBLAST", the first open-source linear algebra-based graph framework on GPU targeting high-performance computing. The results show that on a single GPU, GraphBLAST has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over previous GraphBLAS implementations SuiteSparse and GBTL, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives and shared-memory graph frameworks Ligra and Gunrock, and better performance than any other GPU graph framework, while offering a simpler and more concise programming model.},

To evaluate the proposed method in a parallel ICCG (Incomplete Cholesky Conjugate Gradient) solver, numerical tests were conducted using five test matrices on three types of computational nodes. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional block and nodal multi-color ordering methods in 13 out of 15 test cases, which confirms the effectiveness of the method.},

Through numerical experiments, we show that AASRJ is competitive with the optimal version of the SRJ method [J. Comput.

Several factors affect the performance of SpMV computations, such as matrix characteristics, storage formats, software and hardware platforms. The complexity of the computer systems is on the rise with the increasing number of cores per processor, different levels of caches, processors per node and high speed interconnect. There is an ever-growing need for new optimization techniques and efficient ways of exploiting parallelism. In this paper, we propose ZAKI, a data-driven, machine-learning approach and tool, to predict the optimal number of processes for SpMV computations of an arbitrary sparse matrix on a distributed memory machine. The aim herein is to allow application scientists to automatically obtain the best configuration, and hence the best performance, for the execution of SpMV computations. We train and test the tool using nearly 2000 real world matrices obtained from 45 application domains including computational fluid dynamics (CFD), computer vision, and robotics. The tool uses three machine learning methods, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, and is evaluated in depth. A discussion on the applicability of our proposed tool to energy efficiency optimization of SpMV computations is given. This is the first work where the sparsity structure of matrices have been exploited to predict the optimal number of processes for a given matrix in distributed memory environments by using different base and ensemble machine learning methods.},

First, it introduces a much more efficient double-U dependency detection algorithm to make the detection much simpler. Second, we observe that the potential parallelism is different as the matrix factorization goes on. We then develop three different modes of GPU kernel to adapt to different stages to accommodate the computing task changes in the factorization. As a result, the new GLU can dynamically allocate GPU blocks and wraps based on the number of columns in a level to better balance the computing demands and resources during the LU factorization process. Experimental results on circuit matrices from University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection (UFL) show that the GLU3.0 can deliver 2-3 orders of magnitude speedup over GLU2.0 for the data dependency detection. Furthermore, GLU3.0 achieve 13.0$\times$ (arithmetic mean) and 6.7$\times$ (geometric mean) speedup over GLU2.0 and 7.1$\times$ (arithmetic mean) and 4.8$\times$ (geometric mean) over the recently proposed enhanced GLU2.0 sparse LU solver on the same set of circuit matrices.},

The computational complexity of our SampleSelect algorithm is comparable to specialized algorithms designed for - and exploiting the characteristics of - "pleasant" data distributions. At the same time, as the SampleSelect does not work on the actual values but the ranks of the elements only, it is robust to the input data and can complete significantly faster for adversarial data distributions.

The solver is able to exploit chordal sparsity in the problem data and to detect infeasible problems. The low per-iteration computational cost makes the method particularly efficient for large problems, e.g. semidefinite programs in portfolio optimisation, graph theory, and robust control. Our Julia implementation is open-source, extensible, integrated into the Julia optimisation ecosystem and performs well on a variety of large convex problem classes.}

A lot of reletead work has been carried out to optimize parallel SpMV on CPU-GPU platforms, which mainly focuses on reducing the computing overhead on the GPU, including branch divergence and cache missing, and little attention was paid to the overall efficiency of the heterogeneous platform. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of an adaptive sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) on CPU-GPU heterogeneous architecture. We propose a dynamic task scheduling framework for CPU-GPU platform to improve the utilization of both CPU and GPU. A double buffering scheme is also presented to hide the data transfer overhead between CPU and GPU. Two deeply optimized SpMV kernels are deployed for CPU and GPU respectively. The evaluation on typical sparse matrices indicates that the proposed algorithm obtains both significant performance increase and adaptability to different types of sparse matrices.}

Parallelizing nested loops is notoriously unfriendly to both CPU and memory access when dealing with real graph data due to its skewed distribution. To address this problem, we present SilverChunk, a high performance graph processing system. SilverChunk builds edge chunks of equal size from original graphs and unfolds nested loops statically in pull-based executions (VR-Chunk) and dynamically in push-based executions (D-Chunk). VR-Chunk slices the entire graph into several chunks. A virtual vertex is generated pointing to the first half of each sliced edge list so that no edge list lives in more than one chunk. D-Chunk builds its chunk list via binary searching over the prefix degree sum array of the active vertices. Each chunk has a local buffer for conflict-free maintenance of the next frontier. By changing the units of scheduling from edges to chunks, SilverChunk achieves better CPU and memory utilization. SilverChunk provides a high level programming interface combined with multiple optimization techniques to help developing efficient graph processing applications. Our evaluation results reveal that SilverChunk outperforms state-of-the-art shared-memory graph processing systems by up to $4\times4$, including Gemini, Grazelle, etc. Moreover, it has lower memory overheads and nearly zero pre-processing time.}

Recent advances in dense numerical linear algebra have enabled the routine treatment of eigenvalue problems with dimensions on the order of hundreds of thousands on the world's largest supercomputers. In cases where dense treatments are not feasible, Krylov subspace methods offer an attractive alternative due to the fact that they do not require storage of the problem matrices. However, demonstration of scalability of either of these classes of eigenvalue algorithms on computing architectures capable of expressing excessive parallelism is non-trivial due to communication requirements and serial bottlenecks, respectively. In this work, we introduce the SISLICE method: a parallel shift-invert algorithm for the solution of the symmetric self-consistent field (SCF) eigenvalue problem. The SISLICE method drastically reduces the communication requirement of current parallel shift-invert eigenvalue algorithms through various shift selection and migration techniques based on density of states estimation and k-means clustering, respectively. This work demonstrates the robustness and parallel performance of the SISLICE method on a representative set of SCF eigenvalue problems and outlines research directions which will be explored in future work.},

We also study the effectiveness of the overall scheme for a variety of coarsening schemes. We present experimental results on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that this new scheme produces partitions that are of comparable or better quality than those produced by the multilevel bisection algorithm and requires substantially smaller time. Graphs containing up to 450,000 vertices and 3,300,000 edges can be partitioned in 256 domains in less than 40 s on a workstation such as SGI's Challenge.

The quality of the computed acyclic partitions is assessed by computing the edge cut. We also propose effective ways to use the standard undirected graph partitioning methods in our multilevel scheme. We perform a large set of experiments on a dataset consisting of (i) graphs coming from an application and (ii) some others corresponding to matrices from a public collection. We report significant improvements compared to the current state of the art.}

  abstract     = {Sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a computational primitive that is widely used in areas ranging from traditional numerical applications to recent big data analysis and machine learning. Although many SpGEMM algorithms have been proposed, hardware specific optimizations for multi- and many-core processors are lacking and a detailed analysis of their performance under various use cases and matrices is not available. We firstly identify and mitigate multiple bottlenecks with memory management and thread scheduling on Intel Xeon Phi (Knights Landing or KNL). Specifically targeting many-core processors, we develop a hash-table-based algorithm and optimize a heap-based shared-memory SpGEMM algorithm. We examine their performance together with other publicly available codes. Different from the literature, our evaluation also includes use cases that are representative of real graph algorithms, such as multi-source breadth-first search or triangle counting. Our hash-table and heap-based algorithms are showing significant speedups from libraries in the majority of the cases while different algorithms dominate the other scenarios with different matrix size, sparsity, compression factor and operation type. We wrap up in-depth evaluation results and make a recipe to give the best SpGEMM algorithm for target scenario. We build the performance model for hash-table and heap-based algorithms, which supports the recipe. A critical finding is that hash-table-based SpGEMM gets a significant performance boost if the nonzeros are not required to be sorted within each row of the output matrix. Finally, we integrate our implementations into a large-scale protein clustering code named HipMCL, accelerating its SpGEMM kernel by up to 10X and achieving an overall performance boost for the whole HipMCL application by 2.6$\times$.},

To address this dearth of public, microarchitectural-level information on the novel NVIDIA GPUs, independent researchers have resorted to microbenchmarks-based dissection and discovery. This has led to a prolific line of publications that shed light on instruction encoding, and memory hierarchy's geometry and features at each level. Namely, research that describes the performance and behavior of the Kepler, Maxwell and Pascal architectures. In this technical report, we continue this line of research by presenting the microarchitectural details of the NVIDIA Volta architecture, discovered through microbenchmarks and instruction set disassembly.

Last year, these very reasons motivated us to dissect the Volta GPU architecture using microbenchmarks. The introduction in August 2018 of Turing, NVidia's latest architecture, pressed us to update our study. In this report, we examine Turing and compare it quantitatively against previous NVidia GPU generations. Specifically, we study the T4 GPU: a low-power board aiming at inference applications. We describe its improvements against its inference-oriented predecessor: the P4 GPU based on the Pascal architecture. Both T4 and P4 GPUs achieve significantly higher frequency-per-Watt figures than their full-size counterparts. We study the performance of the T4's TensorCores, finding a much higher throughput on low-precision operands than on the P4 GPU. We reveal that Turing introduces new instructions that express matrix math more succinctly. We map Turing's instruction space, finding the same encoding as Volta, and additional instructions. We reveal that the Turing TU104 chip has the same memory hierarchy depth as the Volta GV100; cache levels sizes on the TU104 are frequently twice as large as those found on the Pascal GP104. We benchmark each constituent of the T4 memory hierarchy and find substantial overall performance improvements over its P4 predecessor. We studied how clock throttling affects compute-intensive workloads that hit power or thermal limits. Many of our findings are novel, published here for the first time. All of them can guide high-performance software developers get closer to the GPU's peak performance.},

A challenge is that for the existing hardware landscape (x86, GPUs, etc.), only a subset of the required batched operations is implemented by the vendors, with limited support for very small problem sizes. We describe the design and performance of a new class of batched triangular dense linear algebra kernels on very small data sizes (up to 256) using single and multiple GPUs.

  abstract   = {Block low-rank (BLR) matrices possess a blockwise low-rank property that can be exploited to reduce the complexity of numerical linear algebra algorithms. The impact of these lowrank approximations on the numerical stability of the algorithms in floating-point arithmetic has not previously been analyzed. We present rounding error analysis for the solution of a linear system by LU factorization of BLR matrices. Assuming that a stable pivoting scheme is used, we prove backward stability: the relative backward error is bounded by a modest constant times $\epsilon$, where the low-rank threshold $\epsilon$ is the parameter controlling the accuracy of the blockwise low-rank approximations. In addition to this key result, our analysis offers three new insights into the numerical behavior of BLR algorithms. First, we compare the use of a global or local low-rank threshold and find that a global one should be preferred. Second, we show that performing intermediate recompressions during the factorization can significantly reduce its cost without compromising numerical stability. Third, we consider different BLR factorization variants and determine the compress--factor--update (CFU) variant to be the best. Tests on a wide range of matrices from various real-life applications show that the predictions from the analysis are realized in practice.}

Because of the exponentials that these functions contain, the evaluation is prone to overflow and underflow, especially in low precision arithmetic. Software implementations commonly use alternative formulas that avoid overflow and reduce the chance of harmful underflow, employing a shift or another rewriting. Although mathematically equivalent, these variants behave differently in floating-point arithmetic. We give rounding error analyses of different evaluation algorithms and interpret the error bounds using condition numbers for the functions. We conclude, based on the analysis and numerical experiments, that the shifted formulas are of similar accuracy to the unshifted ones and that the shifted softmax formula is typically more accurate than a division-free variant.},

However, efficient implementations may require expert knowledge and problem-specific features. Recently, there is renewed interest in making these methods accessible to general users by developing generic decomposition frameworks and modelling support.

Level 1 Sparse BLAS routines do computations over sparse vector and spare/dense vector. Level 2 deals with sparse matrix and vector operations. Level 3 deals with sparse matrix and dense matrix operations. The computations of these Sparse BLAS routines on General Purpose Processors (GPPs) not only suffer from less utilization of hardware resources but also takes more compute time than the workload due to poor data locality of sparse vector/matrix storage formats. In the literature, tremendous efforts have been put into software to improve these Sparse BLAS routines performance on GPPs. GPPs best suit for applications with high data locality, whereas Sparse BLAS routines operate on applications with less data locality hence, GPPs performance is poor. Various Custom Function Units (Hardware Accelerators) are proposed in the literature and are proved to be efficient than soft wares which tried to accelerate Sparse BLAS subroutines. Though existing hardware accelerators improved the Sparse BLAS performance compared to software Sparse BLAS routines, there is still lot of scope to improve these accelerators. This thesis describes both the existing software and hardware software co-designs (HW/SW co-design) and identifies the limitations of these existing solutions. We propose a new sparse data representation called Sawtooth Compressed Row Storage (SCRS) and corresponding SpMV and SpMM algorithms. SCRS based SpMV and SpMM are performing better than existing software solutions. Even though SCRS based SpMV and SpMM algorithms perform better than existing solutions, they still could not reach theoretical peak performance. The knowledge gained from the study of limitations of these existing solutions including the proposed SCRS based SpMV and SpMM is used to propose new HW/SW co-designs. Software accelerators are limited by the hardware properties of GPPs, and GPUs itself, hence, we propose HW/SW co-designs to accelerate few basic Sparse BLAS operations (SpVV and SpMV). Our proposed Parallel Sparse BLAS HW/SW co-design achieves near theoretical peak performance with reasonable hardware resources.}

Load imbalance is one of the major performance degradation factors of parallel applications. Therefore, distributing, cleverly, and as evenly as possible, the workload among processing elements (PE) maximizes application performance. So far, the standard load balancing method consists in distributing the workload evenly between PEs and, when load imbalance appears, redistributing the extra load from overloaded PEs to underloaded PEs. However, this does not anticipate the load imbalance growth that may continue during the next iterations. In this paper, we present a first step toward a novel philosophy of load balancing that unloads the PEs that will be overloaded in the near future to let the application rebalance itself via its own dynamics. Herein, we present a formal definition of our new approach using a simple mathematical model and discuss its advantages compared to the standard load balancing method. In addition to the theoretical study, we apply our method to an application that reproduces the computation of a fluid model with non-uniform erosion. The performance validates the benefit of anticipating load imbalance. We observed up to 16\% performance improvement compared to the standard load balancing method.},

  title       = {Fundamental Results on Asynchronous Parallel Optimization Algorithms},
  abstract    = {In this thesis, we present a body of work on the performance and convergence properties of asynchronous-parallel algorithms completed over the course of my doctorate degree (Hannah, Feng, and Wotao Yin 2018; Hannah and Wotao Yin 2017b; T. Sun, Hannah, and Wotao Yin 2017; Hannah and Wotao Yin 2017a). Asynchronous algorithms eliminate the costly synchronization penalty of traditional synchronous-parallel algorithms. They do this by having computing nodes utilize the most recently available information to compute updates. However, it's not immediately clear whether the trade-off of eliminating synchronization penalty at the cost of using outdated information is favorable.\\ We first give a comprehensive theoretical justification of the performance advantages of asynchronous algorithms, which we summarize as "Faster Iterations, Same Quality" (Hannah and Wotao Yin 2017a). Under a well-justified model, we show that asynchronous algorithms complete "Faster Iterations". Using renewal theory, we demonstrate how network delays, heterogeneous sub-problem difficulty and computing power greatly hinder synchronous algorithms, but have no impact on their asynchronous counterparts. We next prove the first exact convergence rate results for a variety of synchronous algorithms including synchronous ARock and synchronous randomized block coordinate descent (sync-RBCD). This allows us to make a fair comparison between these algorithms and their asynchronous counterparts.\\ Finally we show that a variety of asynchronous algorithms have a convergence rate that essentially matches the previously derived exact rates for synchronous counterparts so long as the delays are not too large. Hence asynchronous algorithms complete faster iteration that are of the "Same Quality" as synchronous algorithms. Therefore we conclude that a wide variety of asynchronous algorithms will always outcompete their synchronous counterparts if the delays are not too large, and especially at scale. \\ Next we present the first asynchonous Nesterov-accelerated algorithm that attains a speedup: A2BCD (Hannah, Feng, and Wotao Yin 2018). We first prove that A2BCD attains NU_ACDM's complexity to highest order. NU_ACDM is a state-of-the-art accelerated coordinate descent algorithm (Allen-Zhu, Qu, et al. 2016). Then we show that both A2BCD and NU_ACDM both have optimal complexity. Hence because A2BCD has faster iterations, and optimal complexity, it should be the fastest coordinate descent algorithm. We verify this with numerical experiments comparing A2BCD with NU_ACDM. We find that A2BCD is up to 4-5$\times$ faster than NU_ACDM, and hence conclude that our algorithm is the current fastest coordinate descent algorithm that exists. Finally we derive a second-order ODE, which is the continuoustime limit of A2BCD. The ODE analysis motivates and clarifies our proof strategy. \\ Lastly, we present earlier foundational work that comprises the basis of the technical innovations that made the previous results possible (Hannah and Wotao Yin 2017b). We show that ARock and its many special cases may converge even under unbounded delays (both stochastic and deterministic). These results sidestep longstanding impossibility results derived in the 1980s by making slightly stronger assumptions. They were also an early demonstration of the power of meticulous Lyapunov-function construction techniques pioneered in this body of work.}

We consider a mixed precision block FMA that generalizes both the usual scalar FMA and existing tensor units. We describe how to exploit such a block FMA in the numerical linear algebra kernels of matrix multiplication and LU factorization and give rounding error analyses of both kernels. An important application is to GMRES-based iterative refinement with block FMAs, for which our analysis provides new insight. Our framework is applicable to the tensor core units in the NVIDIA Volta and Turing GPUs. For these we compare matrix multiplication and LU factorization with TC16 and TC32 forms of FMA, which differ in the precision used for the output of the tensor cores. Our experiments on an NVDIA V100 GPU confirm the predictions of the analysis that the TC32 variant is much more accurate than the TC16 one, while achieving almost the same performance.}

  abstract    = {The advent of efficient interior point optimization methods has enabled the tractable solution of large-scale linear and nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. A prominent example of such a method is seen in Ipopt, a widely-used, open-source nonlinear optimization solver. Algorithmically, Ipopt depends on the use of a sparse symmetric indefinite linear system solver, which is heavily employed within the optimization of barrier subproblems. As such, the performance and reliability of Ipopt is dependent on the properties of the selected linear solver. Inspired by a trend in mathematical programming toward solving larger and more challenging NLPs, this work explores two core questions: first, how does the scalability of available linear solvers, many of which exhibit shared-memory parallelism, impact Ipopt performance; and second, does the best linear solver vary across NLP problem classes, including nonlinear network problems and problems constrained by partial differential equations? To better understand these properties, this paper first describes available open- and closed-source, serial and parallel linear solvers and the fundamental differences among them. Second, it introduces the coupling of a new open-source linear solver capable of heterogeneous parallelism over multi-core central processing units and graphics processing units. Third, it compares linear solvers using a variety of mathematical programming problems, including standard test problems for linear and nonlinear optimization, optimal power flow benchmarks, and scalable two- and three-dimensional partial differential equation and optimal control problems. Finally, linear solver recommendations are provided to maximize Ipopt performance across different application domains.},

  abstract  = {We present a multistage procedure to cluster directed and undirected weighted graphs by finding the block structure of their adjacency matrices. A central part of the process is to scale the adjacency matrix into a doubly-stochastic form, which permits detection of the whole matrix block structure with minimal spectral information (theoretically a single pair of singular vectors suffices).We present the different stages of our method, namely the impact of the doubly-stochastic scaling on singular vectors, detection of the block structure by means of these vectors, and details such as cluster refinement and a stopping criterion. Then we test thealgorithm's effectiveness by using it on two unsupervised classification tasks: community detection in networks and shape detection in cloudsof points in two dimensions. By comparing results of our approach with thoseof widely used algorithms designed for specific purposes, we observe that our method is competitive (for community detection) if not superior (for shape detection) in comparison with existing methods.}

In addition, our theory provides a more refined understanding of the statistical and computational trade-off in the problem of sparse principal component estimation, revealing a subtle interplay between the effective sample size and the number of random projections that are required to achieve the minimax optimal rate.

  abstract    = {Convolution neural network (CNN) plays a paramount role in machine learning, which has made significant contributions, such as medical image classification, natural language processing, and recommender system. The success convolution neural network achieved excellent performance with fast execution time. Due to the convolution operation dominate the total operation time of Convolution neural network. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution method of Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which reduce the convolution operation time and improve the execution speed approximately 2$\times$ than the state of the art convolution algorithm. Our work based on the observation is that the sparsity of the input feature map of convolution operation is relatively large, and the zero value of the feature map is redundancy for convolution result. Therefore, we skip the zero value calculation and improve the speed by compressing the feature map. Besides, the shape of the feature map for the deep network is small, and the number of threads is limited. Therefore, for a limited number of threads, it is necessary to reduce the amount of calculation to increase the calculation speed. Our algorithm has a good effect on the convolution operation of the feature map of the deep network with large sparsity and small size. In this work, our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1) A novel store format for hight-sparsity feature map. 2) A novel convolution algorithm based on block compression and Shared memory is proposed. 3) A feature map data-set for convolution algorithm optimization. 4) We performed a single-layer convolution comparison experiment with CuDNN for different models, and it is best to achieve 3.5$\times$ speedup. We also implemented the algorithm on the VGG-19 model, which can achieve 1.3$\times$$\sim$2.9$\times$ speedup in deep convolution operation, and the entire network can achieve 2.3$\times$ speedup.},

  abstract     = {3D visual computing data are often spatially sparse. To exploit such sparsity, people have developed hierarchical sparse data structures, such as multilevel sparse voxel grids, particles, and 3D hash tables. However, developing and using these high-performance sparse data structures is challenging, due to their intrinsic complexity and overhead. We propose Taichi, a new data-oriented programming language for efficiently authoring, accessing, and maintaining such data structures. The language offers a high-level, data structure-agnostic interface for writing computation code. The user independently specifies the data structure. We provide several elementary components with different sparsity properties that can be arbitrarily composed to create a wide range of multi-level sparse data structures. This decoupling of data structures from computation makes it easy to experiment with different data structures without changing computation code, and allows users to write computation as if they are working with a dense array. Our compiler then uses the semantics of the data structure and index analysis to automatically optimize for locality, remove redundant operations for coherent accesses, maintain sparsity and memory allocations, and generate efficient parallel and vectorized instructions for CPUs and GPUs. \\ Our approach yields competitive performance on common computational kernels such as stencil applications, neighbor lookups, and particle scattering. We demonstrate our language by implementing simulation, rendering, and vision tasks including a material point method simulation, finite element analysis, a multigrid Poisson solver for pressure projection, volumetric path tracing, and 3D convolution on sparse grids. Our computation-data structure decoupling allows us to quickly experiment with different data arrangements, and to develop high-performance data structures tailored for specific computational tasks. With $\frac{1}{10}$th as many lines of code, we achieve 4.55$\times$ higher performance on average, compared to hand-optimized reference implementations.}

In this work, we are concerned with a spatial partitioning called rectilinear partitioning (also known as generalized block distribution) of sparse matrices, which is needed for tiled (or {\em blocked}) execution of sparse matrix and graph analytics kernels. More specifically, in this work, we address the problem of symmetric rectilinear partitioning of square matrices. By symmetric, we mean having the same partition on rows and columns of the matrix, yielding a special tiling where the diagonal tiles (blocks) will be squares. We propose five heuristics to solve two different variants of this problem, and present a thorough experimental evaluation showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Many applications perform frequent scatter update operations to large data structures. For example, in push-style graph algorithms, processing each vertex requires updating the data of all its neighbors. Neighbors are often scattered over the whole graph, so these scatter updates have poor spatial and temporal locality. In current systems, scatter updates suffer high synchronization costs and high memory traffic. These drawbacks make push-style execution unattractive, and, when algorithms allow it, programmers gravitate towards pull-style implementations based on gather reads instead. \\ We present PHI, a push cache hierarchy that makes scatter updates synchronization- and bandwidth-efficient. PHI adds support for pushing sparse, commutative updates from cores towards main memory. PHI adds simple compute logic at each cache level to buffer and coalesce these commutative updates throughout the hierarchy. This avoids synchronization, exploits temporal locality, and produces a load balanced execution. Moreover, PHI exploits spatial locality by selectively deferring updates with poor spatial locality, batching them to achieve sequential main memory transfers. \\ PHI is the first system to leverage both the temporal and spatial locality benefits of commutative scatter updates, some of which do not apply to gather reads. As a result, PHI not only makes push algorithms efficient, but makes them consistently faster than pull ones. We evaluate PHI on graph algorithms and other sparse applications processing large inputs. PHI improves performance by 4.7$\times$ on average (and by up to 11$\times$), and reduces memory traffic by 2$\times$ (and by up to 5$\times$).},

  institution = {Ohio State University},
  date        = {2019},
  abstract    = {Sparse matrix/tensor operations have been a common computational motif in a wide spectrum of domains - numerical linear algebra, graph analytics, machine learning, health-care, etc. Sparse kernels play a key role in numerous machine learning algorithms and the rising popularity of this domain increases the significance of the primitives like SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication), SDDMM (Sampled Dense-Dense Matrix Multiplication), MF/TF(Sparse Matrix/Tensor Factorization), etc. These primitives are data-parallel and highly suitable for GPU-like architectures that provide massive parallelism. Real-world matrices and tensors are large-scale and have millions of data points, which is sufficient to utilize all the cores of a GPU. Yet, a data parallel algorithm can become the bottleneck of an application and perform way below than the upper bound of the roofline model. Some common reasons are frequent irregular global memory access, low data reuse, and imbalanced work distribution. However, efficient utilization of GPU memory hierarchy, reduced thread communication, increased data locality , and an even workload distribution can provide ample opportunities for significant performance improvement. The challenge lies in utilizing the techniques across applications and achieve an even performance in spite of the irregularity of the input matrices or tensors. In this work, we systematically identify the performance bottlenecks of the important sparse algorithms and provide optimized and high performing solutions.\\At the beginning of this dissertation, we explore the application of cost-effective ML techniques in solving the format selection and performance modeling problem in the SpMV domain. By identifying a small set of sparse matrix features to use in training the ML models, we are able to select the best storage format, and predict the execution time of an SpMV kernel as well. Next, we optimize the SDDMM kernel, which is a key bottleneck in factor analysis and topic modeling algorithms like ALS, LDA, GaP, ALS, etc. The performance constraints are addressed by exploiting data reuse and increasing parallelism using virtual warping, multi-level tiling and effective use of on-chip memory (shared memory), etc. Rest of the following works are on the optimization of factorization techniques of sparse matrix and tensors on GPUs. For matrix factorization, we optimize the cyclic coordinate descent (CCD++), which is the state-of-the-art factorization method. An efficient GPU implementation is devised by using kernel fusion, tiling and binning. Next, we extend the optimization of the factorization problem to higher order data - tensor. MTTKRP (Matricized Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Products) is a key bottleneck of one of the most common tensor factorization techniques - CPD (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition). We develop new storage-efficient representations, B-CSF and HB-CSF, for tensors that enables high-performance and load-balanced execution of MTTKRP on GPUs. However, for a tensor with d modes, CPD requires a sequence of d tensor computations. To guarantee efficient memory access with respect to different modes, many storage formats store d distinct representations despite d-fold space overhead. Hence, we devise MM-CSF, a compact mixed-mode representation where better performance is achieved compared to existing solutions while utilizing a small fraction of the space.}

Understanding the problem description and file format, writing code to read in the files that define the problem, and comparing our results with the reference solution took a full day. The kernel consists of a single for-loop around 4 lines of code, all of which are calls to GraphBLAS, and it worked perfectly the first time it was compiled. The sequential performance of the GraphBLAS solution is 3$\times$ to 5$\times$ faster than the MATLAB reference implementation. OpenMP parallelism gives an additional 10$\times$ to 15$\times$ speedup on a 20-core Intel processor, 17$\times$ on an IBM Power8 system, and 20$\times$ on a Power9 system, for the largest problems. Since SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS does not yet employ MPI, this was added at the application level, a development effort that took one week, primarily because of difficulties in resolving a load-balancing issue in the MPI-based parallel algorithm.}

  abstract    = {Distributed data structures are key to implementing scalable applications for scientific simulations and data analysis. In this paper we look at two implementation styles for distributed data structures: remote direct memory access (RDMA) and remote procedure call (RPC). We focus on operations that require individual accesses to remote portions of a distributed data structure, e.g., accessing a hash table bucket or distributed queue, rather than global operations in which all processors collectively exchange information. We look at the trade-offs between the two styles through microbenchmarks and a performance model that approximates the cost of each. The RDMA operations have direct hardware support in the network and therefore lower latency and overhead, while the RPC operations are more expressive but higher cost and can suffer from lack of attentiveness from the remote side. We also run experiments to compare the real-world performance of RDMA- and RPC-based data structure operations with the predicted performance to evaluate the accuracy of our model, and show that while the model does not always precisely predict running time, it allows us to choose the best implementation in the examples shown. We believe this analysis will assist developers in designing data structures that will perform well on current network architectures, as well as network architects in providing better support for this class of distributed data structures.},

For example, images usually contain a heterogeneous set of objects, and thus it is a challenging task to reconstruct images with high levels of missing data. In this paper, we propose the sparse reverse of principal component analysis for matrix completion. The proposed approach maintains smoothness across the matrix, produces accurate estimates of the missing data, converges iteratively, and it is computationally tractable with a controllable upper bound on the number of iterations until convergence.

Whereas the BiCG (Fletcher, 1976), CGS (Sonneveld, 1989) and BiCGSTAB (van der Vorst, 1992) iterates may not exist when the tridiagonal projection of A is singular, BiLQ is reliable on compatible systems even if A is ill-conditioned or rank deficient. As in the symmetric case, the BiCG residual is often smaller than the BiLQ residual and, when the BiCG iterate exists, an inexpensive transfer from the BiLQ iterate is possible. Although the Euclidean norm of the BiLQ error is usually not monotonic, it is monotonic in a different norm that depends on the Lanczos vectors. We establish a similar property for the QMR (Freund and Nachtigal, 1991) residual. BiLQ combines with QMR to take advantage of two initial vectors and solve a system and an adjoint system simultaneously at a cost similar to that of applying either method. We derive an analogous combination of USYMLQ and USYMQR based on the orthogonal tridiagonalization process (Saunders, Simon, and Yip, 1988). The resulting combinations, named BiLQR and TriLQR, may be used to estimate integral functionals involving the solution of a primal and an adjoint system. We compare BiLQR and TriLQR with Minres-qlp on a related augmented system, which performs a comparable amount of work and requires comparable storage. In our experiments, BiLQR terminates earlier than TriLQR and MINRES-QLP in terms of residual and error of the primal and adjoint systems.},

  abstract  = {Important workloads, such as machine learning and graph analytics applications, heavily involve sparse linear algebra operations. These operations use sparse matrix compression as an effective means to avoid storing zeros and performing unnecessary computation on zero elements. However, compression techniques like Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) that are widely used today introduce significant instruction overhead and expensive pointer-chasing operations to discover the positions of the non-zero elements. In this paper, we identify the discovery of the positions (i.e., indexing) of non-zero elements as a key bottleneck in sparse matrix-based workloads, which greatly reduces the benefits of compression.\\ We propose SMASH, a hardware-software cooperative mechanism that enables highly-efficient indexing and storage of sparse matrices. The key idea of SMASH is to explicitly enable the hardware to recognize and exploit sparsity in data. To this end, we devise a novel software encoding based on a hierarchy of bitmaps. This encoding can be used to efficiently compress any sparse matrix, regardless of the extent and structure of sparsity. At the same time, the bitmap encoding can be directly interpreted by the hardware. We design a lightweight hardware unit, the Bitmap Management Unit (BMU), that buffers and scans the bitmap hierarchy to perform highly-efficient indexing of sparse matrices. SMASH exposes an expressive and rich ISA to communicate with the BMU, which enables its use in accelerating any sparse matrix computation.\\We demonstrate the benefits of SMASH on four use cases that include sparse matrix kernels and graph analytics applications. Our evaluations show that SMASH provides average performance improvements of 38\% for Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication and 44\% for Sparse Matrix Matrix Multiplication, over a state-of-the-art CSR implementation, on a wide variety of matrices with different characteristics. SMASH incurs a very modest hardware area overhead of up to 0.076\% of an out-of-order CPU core.},

  annotation = {Generalized tensor algebra is a prime candidate for acceleration via customized ASICs. Modern tensors feature a wide range of data sparsity, with the density of non-zero elements ranging from 10-6\% to 50\%. This paper proposes a novel approach to accelerate tensor kernels based on the principle of hierarchical elimination of computation in the presence of sparsity. This approach relies on rapidly finding intersections---situations where both operands of a multiplication are non-zero---enabling new data fetching mechanisms and avoiding memory latency overheads associated with sparse kernels implemented in software.\\ We propose the ExTensor accelerator, which builds these novel ideas on handling sparsity into hardware to enable better bandwidth utilization and compute throughput. We evaluate ExTensor on several kernels relative to industry libraries (Intel MKL) and state-of-the-art tensor algebra compilers (TACO). When bandwidth normalized, we demonstrate an average speedup of 3.4$\times$, 1.3$\times$, 2.8$\times$, 24.9$\times$, and 2.7$\times$ on SpMSpM, SpMM, TTV, TTM, and SDDMM kernels respectively over a server class CPU.},

However, the great success comes at the cost of excessive computation due to the over-provisioned parameter space. To improve the computation efficiency of neural networks, many pruning techniques have been proposed to reduce the amount of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which results in high sparsity in the networks.\\ Unfortunately, the sparse neural networks often run slower than their dense counterparts on modern GPUs due to their poor device utilization rate. In particular, as the sophisticated hardware primitives (e.g., Tensor Core) have been deployed to boost the performance of dense matrix multiplication by an order of magnitude, the performance of sparse neural networks lags behind significantly.\\ In this work, we propose an algorithm and hardware co-design methodology to accelerate the sparse neural networks. A novel pruning algorithm is devised to improve the workload balance and reduce the decoding overhead of the sparse neural networks. Meanwhile, new instructions and micro-architecture optimization are proposed in Tensor Core to adapt to the structurally sparse neural networks. Our experimental results show that the pruning algorithm can achieve 63\% performance gain with model accuracy sustained. Furthermore, the hardware optimization gives an additional 58\% performance gain with negligible area overhead.},

  abstract  = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for image processing. Recent machine learning work has reduced CNNs' compute and data volumes by exploiting the naturally-occurring and actively-transformed zeros in the feature maps and filters. While previous semi-sparse architectures exploit one-sided sparsity either in the feature maps or the filters, but not both, a recent fully-sparse architecture, called Sparse CNN (SCNN), exploits two-sided sparsity to improve performance and energy over dense architectures. However, sparse vector-vector dot product, a key primitive in sparse CNNs, would be inefficient using the representation adopted by SCNN. The dot product requires finding and accessing non-zero elements in matching positions in the two sparse vectors -- an inner join using the position as the key with a single value field. SCNN avoids the inner join by performing a Cartesian product capturing the relevant multiplications. However, SCNN's approach incurs several considerable overheads and is not applicable to non-unit-stride convolutions. Further, exploiting reuse in sparse CNNs fundamentally causes systematic load imbalance not addressed by SCNN. We propose SparTen which achieves efficient inner join by providing support for native two-sided sparse execution and memory storage. To tackle load imbalance, SparTen employs a software scheme, called greedy balancing, which groups filters by density via two variants, a software-only one which uses whole-filter density and a software-hardware hybrid which uses finer-grain density. Our simulations show that, on average, SparTen performs 4.7$\times$, 1.8$\times$, and 3$\times$ better than a dense architecture, one-sided sparse architecture, and SCNN, respectively. An FPGA implementation shows that SparTen performs 4.3$\times$ and 1.9$\times$ better than a dense architecture and a one-sided sparse architecture, respectively.},

  abstract    = {We present the design and optimization of a solver for efficient and high-throughput computation of the marginalized graph kernel on General Purpose GPUs. The graph kernel is computed using the conjugate gradient method to solve a generalized Laplacian of the tensor product between a pair of graphs. To cope with the large gap between the instruction throughput and the memory bandwidth of the GPUs, our solver forms the graph tensor product on-the-fly without storing it in memory. This is achieved by using threads in a warp cooperatively to stream the adjacency and edge label matrices of individual graphs by small square matrix blocks called tiles, which are then staged in registers and the shared memory for later reuse. Warps across a thread block can further share tiles via the shared memory to increase data reuse. We exploit the sparsity of the graphs hierarchically by storing only non-empty tiles using a coordinate format and nonzero elements within each tile using bitmaps. We propose a new partition-based reordering algorithm for aggregating nonzero elements of the graphs into fewer but denser tiles to further exploit sparsity. We carry out extensive theoretical analyses on the graph tensor product primitives for tiles of various density and evaluate their performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our solver delivers three to four orders of magnitude speedup over existing CPU-based solvers such as GraKeL and GraphKernels. The capability of the solver enables kernel-based learning tasks at unprecedented scales.},

Several optimized libraries exist that can achieve high-performance on distributed systems. Only a few of them target distributed GPU-accelerated systems. In most of the cases, these libraries are provided and optimized by system vendors for their specific computer systems. In this paper, we present the DBCSR library (Distributed Block Compressed Sparse Row) for the distributed dense matrix-matrix multiplications. Although the library is specifically designed for block-sparse matrix-matrix multiplications, we optimized it for the dense case on GPU-accelerated systems. We show that the DBCSR outperforms the multiplication of matrices of different sizes and shapes provided by a vendor optimized GPU version of the ScaLAPACK library up to 2.5$\times$ (1.4$\times$ on average).},

We assess the effects of the adaptive precision preconditioner on the iteration count and data transfer cost of a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver. A preconditioned conjugate gradient method is, in general, a memory bandwidth-bound algorithm, and therefore its execution time and energy consumption are largely dominated by the costs of accessing the problem{\textquoteright}s data in memory. Given this observation, we propose a model that quantifies the time and energy savings of our approach based on the assumption that these two costs depend linearly on the bit length of a floating point number. Furthermore, we use a number of test problems from the SuiteSparse matrix collection to estimate the potential benefits of the adaptive block-Jacobi preconditioning scheme.},

Additionally, unstructured matrix with high sparsity pose difficulties as most solutions rely on exploitation of data locality.

This paper provides an introduction to the mathematics of the GraphBLAS. Graphs represent connections between vertices with edges. Matrices can represent a wide range of graphs using adjacency matrices or incidence matrices. Adjacency matrices are often easier to analyze while incidence matrices are often better for representing data. Fortunately, the two are easily connected by matrix multiplication. A key feature of matrix mathematics is that a very small number of matrix operations can be used to manipulate a very wide range of graphs.

Furthermore, it is becoming more commonplace for HPC platforms to utilise a heterogeneous combination of computing devices. Whilst it is desirable to design faster implementations of parallel linear system solvers, power consumption concerns are increasing in priority. This work presents the oclspkt routine. The oclspkt routine is a heterogeneous OpenCL implementation of the truncated SPIKE algorithm that can use FPGAs, GPUs, and CPUs to concurrently accelerate the solving of diagonally dominant tridiagonal linear systems. The routine is designed to solve tridiagonal systems of any size and can dynamically allocate optimised workloads to each accelerator in a heterogeneous environment depending on the accelerator's compute performance. The truncated SPIKE FPGA solver is developed first for optimising OpenCL device kernel performance, global memory bandwidth, and interleaved host to device memory transactions. The FPGA OpenCL kernel code is then refactored and optimised to best exploit the underlying architecture of the CPU and GPU. An optimised TDMA OpenCL kernel is also developed to act as a serial baseline performance comparison for the parallel truncated SPIKE kernel since no FPGA tridiagonal solver capable of solving large tridiagonal systems was available at the time of development. The individual GPU, CPU, and FPGA solvers of the oclspkt routine are 110\%, 150\%, and 170\% faster, respectively, than comparable device-optimised third-party solvers and applicable baselines. Assessing heterogeneous combinations of compute devices, the GPU + FPGA combination is found to have the best compute performance and the FPGA-only configuration is found to have the best overall estimated energy efficiency.},

We verify this conjecture for digraphs with chromatic number at most 6 or dichromatic number at most 3. We obtain analogous results for list coloring: We show that every digraph with list chromatic number at most 6 or list dichromatic number at most 3 is majority 3-choosable. We deduce that digraphs with maximum out-degree at most 4 or maximum degree at most 7 are majority 3-choosable. On the way to these results we investigate digraphs admitting a majority 2-coloring. We show that every digraph without odd directed cycles is majority 2-choosable. We answer an open question posed by Kreutzer et al. negatively, by showing that deciding whether a given digraph is majority 2-colorable is NP-complete. Finally we deal with a fractional relaxation of majority coloring proposed by Kreutzer et al. and show that every digraph has a fractional majority 3.9602-coloring.

  abstract    = {Advanced algorithms for large-scale electronic structure calculations are mostly based on processing multi-dimensional sparse data. Examples are sparse matrix-matrix multiplications in linear-scaling Kohn-Sham calculations or the efficient determination of the exact exchange energy. When going beyond mean field approaches, e.g. for Moller-Plesset perturbation theory, RPA and Coupled-Cluster methods, or the GW methods, it becomes necessary to manipulate higher-order sparse tensors. Very similar problems are also encountered in other domains, like signal processing, data mining, computer vision, and machine learning. With the idea that the most of the tensor operations can be mapped to matrices, we have implemented sparse tensor algebra functionalities in the frames of the sparse matrix linear algebra library DBCSR (Distributed Block Compressed Sparse Row). DBCSR has been specifically designed to efficiently perform blocked-sparse matrix operations, so it becomes natural to extend its functionality to include tensor operations. We describe the newly developed tensor interface and algorithms. In particular, we introduce the tensor contraction based on a fast rectangular sparse matrix multiplication algorithm.},

  abstract    = {Modern optimizing compilers are able to exploit memory access or computation patterns to generate vectorization codes. However, such patterns in irregular applications are unknown until runtime due to the input dependence. Thus, either compiler's static optimization or profile-guided optimization based on specific inputs cannot predict the patterns for any common input, which leads to suboptimal code generation. To address this challenge, we develop Intelligent-Unroll, a framework to automatically optimize irregular applications with vectorization. Intelligent-Unroll allows the users to depict the computation task using \textit{code seed} with the memory access and computation patterns represented in \textit{feature table} and \textit{information-code tree}, and generates highly efficient codes. Furthermore, Intelligent-Unroll employs several novel optimization techniques to optimize reduction operations and gather/scatter instructions. We evaluate Intelligent-Unroll with sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and graph applications. Experimental results show that Intelligent-Unroll is able to generate more efficient vectorization codes compared to the state-of-the-art implementations.},

  abstract    = {Emerging non-volatile main memory (NVRAM) technologies provide novel features for large-scale graph analytics, combining byte-addressability, low idle power, and improved memory-density. Systems are likely to have an order of magnitude more NVRAM than traditional memory (DRAM), allowing large graph problems to be solved efficiently at a modest cost on a single machine. However, a significant challenge in achieving high performance is in accounting for the fact that NVRAM writes can be significantly more expensive than NVRAM reads. In this paper, we propose an approach to parallel graph analytics in which the graph is stored as a read-only data structure (in NVRAM), and the amount of mutable memory is kept proportional to the number of vertices. Similar to the popular semi-external and semi-streaming models for graph analytics, the approach assumes that the vertices of the graph fit in a fast read-write memory (DRAM), but the edges do not. In NVRAM systems, our approach eliminates writes to the NVRAM, among other benefits. We present a model, the Parallel Semi-Asymmetric Model (PSAM), to analyze algorithms in the setting, and run experiments on a 48-core NVRAM system to validate the effectiveness of these algorithms. To this end, we study over a dozen graph problems. We develop parallel algorithms for each that are efficient, often work-optimal, in the model. Experimentally, we run all of the algorithms on the largest publicly-available graph and show that our PSAM algorithms outperform the fastest prior algorithms designed for DRAM or NVRAM. We also show that our algorithms running on NVRAM nearly match the fastest prior algorithms running solely in DRAM, by effectively hiding the costs of repeatedly accessing NVRAM versus DRAM.},

  abstract   = {What is the fastest way to solve a linear system $Ax= b$ in arithmetic of a given precision when $A$ is symmetric positive definite and otherwise unstructured? The usual answer is by Cholesky factorization, assuming that $A$ can be factorized. We develop an algorithm that can be faster, given an arithmetic of precision lower than the working precision as well as (optionally) one of higher precision. The arithmetics might, for example, be of precisions half, single, and double; half and double, possibly with quadruple; or single and double, possibly with quadruple. We compute a Cholesky factorization at the lower precision and use the factors as preconditioners in GMRES-based iterative refinement. To avoid breakdown of the factorization we shift the matrix by a small multiple of its diagonal. We explain why this is preferable to the common approach of shifting by a multiple of the identity matrix, We also incorporate scaling in order to avoid overflow and reduce the chance of underflow when working in IEEE half precision arithmetic. We extend the algorithm to solve a linear least squares problem with a well conditioned coefficient matrix by forming and solving the normal equations. In both algorithms most of the work is done at low precision provided that iterative refinement and the inner iterative solver converge quickly. We explain why replacing GMRES by the conjugate gradient method causes convergence guarantees to be lost, but show that this change has little effect on convergence in practice. Our numerical experiments confirm the potential of the new algorithms to provide faster solutions in environments that support multiple precisions of arithmetic.}

  abstract     = {Querying graphs and conducting graph analytics become important in data processing since there are many real applications dealing with massive graphs, such as online social networks, Semantic Web, knowledge graphs, etc. Over the years, many distributed graph processing systems have been developed to support graph analytics using various programming models, and many graph querying languages have been proposed. A natural question that arises is how to integrate graph data and traditional non-graph data in a distributed system for users to conduct analytics. There are two issues. One issue is related to expressiveness on how to specify graph analytics as well as data analytics by a querying language. The other issue is related to efficiency on how to process analytics in a distributed system. For the first issue, SQL is a best candidate, since SQL is a well-accepted language for data processing. We concentrate on SQL for graph analytics. Our early work shows that graph analytics can be supported by SQL in a way from "semiring + while" to "relational algebra + while" via the enhanced recursive SQL queries. In this paper, we focus on the second issue on how to process such enhanced recursive SQL queries based on the GAS (Gather-Apply-Scatter) model under which efficient graph processing systems can be developed. To demonstrate the efficiency, we implemented a system by tightly coupling Spark SQL and GraphX on Spark which is one of the most popular in-memory data-flow processing platforms. First, we enhance Spark SQL by adding the capability of supporting the enhanced recursive SQL queries for graph analytics. In this regard, graph analytics can be processed using a distributed SQL engine alone. Second, we further propose new transformation rules to optimize/translate the operations for recursive SQL queries to the operations by GraphX. In this regard, graph analytics by SQL can be processed in a similar way as done by a distributed graph processing system using the APIs provided by the system. We conduct extensive performance studies to test graph analytics using large real graphs. We show that our approach can achieve similar or even higher efficiency, in comparison to the built-in graph algorithms in the existing graph processing systems.},

We propose adaptive task aggregation (ATA) to efficiently execute such irregular computations on GPU architectures via hierarchical dependency management and lowlatency task scheduling. On a gamut of  representative problems with different data-dependency structures, ATA significantly outperforms existing GPU task-execution approaches, achieving a geometric mean speedup of 2.2$\times$ to 3.7$\times$ across different sparse kernels (with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude).}

  abstract     = {Due to the GPU's complex memory system and massive thread-level parallelism, application programmers often have difficulty optimizing GPU programs. An essential approach to memory optimization is to utilize low-latency on-chip memory to avoid high latency of off-chip memory accesses. Shared memory is an on-chip memory, which is explicitly managed by programmers. Shared memory has a read/write latency similar to that of the L1 cache, but poor data management can degrade performance. In this paper, we present a static code transformation that preloads dataset in GPU's shared memory. Our static analysis primarily targets global memory requests with high thread-density for preloading in shared memory. The thread-dense memory access pattern is a pattern in which many threads efficiently manage the address space of shared memory, as well as reuse the same data in a thread block. We limit the usage of shared memory so that thread-level parallelism remains at the same level when selecting datasets for preloading. Finally, our source-to-source compiler allows to preload selected datasets in shared memory by transforming non-optimized GPU kernel code. Our methods achieve 1.26$\times$ and 1.62$\times$ speedups on average (geometric mean), respectively with GTX980 and P100 GPUs.},

Despite being very beneficial for serial computation, storing the upper or lower triangular part of the matrix introduces race conditions in the updates to the output vector in a parallel execution. Previous work has suggested using local, per-thread vectors to circumvent this problem, introducing a work-inefficient reduction step that limits the scalability of SpMV. In this paper, we address this issue with Conflict-Free Symmetric (CFS) SpMV, an optimization strategy that organizes the parallel computation into phases of conflict-free execution. We identify such phases through graph coloring and propose heuristics to improve the coloring quality for SpMV in terms of load balancing and locality to the input and output vectors. We evaluate our approach on two multicore shared-memory systems and demonstrate improved performance over the state-of-the-art.},

We study one common operation, Sparse Matrix Multi-Vector Multiplication (SpMM), and evaluate the impact of the sparsity, distribution of non-zero elements, and tile-traversal strategies on GPU implementations. Using these insights, we determine that operating on these sparse matrices in a Densified Compressed Sparse Row (DCSR) is well-suited to the parallel warp-synchronous execution model of the GPU processing elements.\\ Preprocessing or storing the sparse matrix in the DCSR format, however, often requires significantly more memory storage than conventional Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) or Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) formats. Given that SpMM kernels are often bottlenecked on DRAM bandwidth, the increase in DRAM traffic to access the larger DCSR formatted data structure can result in a slowdown for many matrices.\\ We propose a near-memory transform engine to dynamically create DCSR formatted tiles for the GPU processing elements from the CSC formatted matrix in memory. This work enhances a GPU's last-level cache/memory controller unit to act as an efficient translator between the compute-optimized representation of data and its corresponding storage/bandwidth-optimized format to accelerate sparse workloads. Our approach achieves 2.26$\times$ better performance on average compared to the vendor supplied optimized library for sparse matrix operations, cuSPARSE.},

The performance of an irregular application is very dependent upon the dataset. This paper poses the following question: "given an unstructured mesh or a graph, what method(s) can be used to sample it, such that the execution on the resulting sampled dataset can accurately reflect performance characteristics on the full dataset". Our first insight is that developing a universal sampling approach for all sparse matrices is unpractical. According to the non-zero distribution of the sparse matrix, we propose two novel sampling strategies: Stride Average sampling and Random Tile sampling, which are suitable for uniform and skewed sparse matrices respectively. To help categorize a sparse matrix as uniform or skewed, we introduce clustering coefficient as an important feature which can be propagated into the decision tree model. We also adapt Random Node Neighbor sampling approach for efficient estimation of clustering coefficient. We apply our unstructured dataset characterization approach to modeling the performance for SIMD irregular applications, where the sampled dataset obtained is used to predict cache miss rate and SIMD utilization ratio. We also build analytical models to estimate overheads incurred by load imbalance among threads. With knowledge of these factors, we adapt a code skeleton framework SKOPE to capture the workload behaviors and aggregate performance statistics for execution time prediction.},

The straightforward solution is to use d distinct representations of the tensor, with each one being efficient for one of the d computations. However, a d-fold space overhead is often unacceptable in practice, especially with memory-constrained GPUs.

It first embeds the original data into a lower dimensional space with spectral analysis, and then relys on an algorithm to obtain the final cluster labels. Since it involves eigen-decomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix for spectral embedding, spectral clustering suffers from high computational cost as data grow in scale. It is also limited by the performance of post-processing algorithm such as kmeans. To address these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel approach denoted by Orthogonal and Nonnegative Graph Reconstruction (ONGR) for large scale clustering. The two constraints are served as the structure constraint under which the graph reconstructed by the indicator matrix is structured. The proposed method mainly needs to perform economical singular value decomposition for small size matrix thus it scales linearly with the data size. Moreover, the interpretability of the indicator matrix is offered due to the nonnegative constraint. Therefore, the final cluster labels can be directly obtained without post-processing. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

For these reasons, out-of-core methods have been actively developed for machine learning and graph processing. The goal of this paper is to develop an efficient out-of-core matrix completion method based on coordinate descent approach. Coordinate descent-based matrix completion (CD-MC) has two strong benefits over other approaches: 1) it does not involve heavy computation such as matrix inversion and 2) it does not have step-size hyper-parameters, which reduces the effort for hyper-parameter tuning. Existing solutions for CD-MC have been developed and analyzed for in-memory setting and they do not take disk-I/O into account. Thus, we propose OCam, a novel out-of-core coordinate descent algorithm for matrix completion. Our evaluation results and cost analyses provide sound evidences supporting the following benefits of OCam: (1) Scalability -- OCam is a truly scalable out-of-core method and thus decomposes a matrix larger than the size of memory, (2) Efficiency -- OCam is super fast. OCam is up to 10$\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art out-of-core method, and up to 4.1$\times$ faster than a competing distributed method when using eight machines. The source code of OCam will be available for reproducibility.},

Yet, the neural networks with the capability to tackle real-world problems are intrinsically expensive in computation, hindering the usage of these models. Sparsity in the input data of neural networks provides an optimizing opportunity. However, harnessing the potential performance improvement on modern CPU faces challenges raised by sparse computations of the neural network, such as cache-unfriendly memory accesses and efficient sparse kernel implementation. In this paper, we propose Acorns, a framework to accelerate deep neural networks with input sparsity. In Acorns, sparse input data is organized into our designed sparse data layout, which allows memory-friendly access for kernels in neural networks and opens the door for many performance-critical optimizations. Upon that, Acorns generates efficient sparse kernels for operators in neural networks from kernel templates, which combine directions that express specific optimizing transformations to be performed, and straightforward code that describes the computation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate Acorns can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by significant speedups. On the real-world detection task in autonomous driving, Acorns demonstrates 1.8-22.6$\times$ performance improvement over baselines. Specifically, the generated programs achieve 1.8-2.4$\times$ speedups over Intel MKL-DNN, 3.0-8.8$\times$ speedups over TensorFlow, and 11.1-13.2$\times$ speedups over Intel MKL-Sparse.},

SLATE will provide coverage of existing ScaLAPACK functionality, including the parallel BLAS; linear systems using LU and Cholesky; least squares problems using QR; and eigenvalue and singular value problems. In this respect, it will serve as a replacement for ScaLAPACK, which after two decades of operation, cannot adequately be retrofitted for modern accelerated architectures. SLATE uses modern techniques such as communication-avoiding algorithms, lookahead panels to overlap communication and computation, and task-based scheduling, along with a modern C++ framework. Here we present the design of SLATE and initial reports of several of its components.},

At the heart of this deep learning revolution are familiar concepts from applied and computational mathematics, notably from calculus, approximation theory, optimization, and linear algebra. This article provides a very brief introduction to the basic ideas that underlie deep learning from an applied mathematics perspective. Our target audience includes postgraduate and final year undergraduate students in mathematics who are keen to learn about the area. The article may also be useful for instructors in mathematics who wish to enliven their classes with references to the application of deep learning techniques. We focus on three fundamental questions: What is a deep neural network? How is a network trained? What is the stochastic gradient method? We illustrate the ideas with a short MATLAB code that sets up and trains a network. We also demonstrate the use of state-of-the-art software on a large scale image classification problem. We finish with references to the current literature.},

In nonconvex optimization, symmetry can negatively affect algorithm performance, e.g., of branch-and-bound when symmetry induces many equivalent branches. This paper develops detection methods for symmetry groups in quadratically-constrained quadratic optimization problems. Representing the optimization problem with adjacency matrices, we use graph theory to transform the adjacency matrices into binary layered graphs. We enter the binary layered graphs into the software package nauty that generates important symmetric properties of the original problem. Symmetry pattern knowledge motivates a discretization pattern that we use to reduce computation time for an approximation of the point packing problem. This paper highlights the importance of detecting and classifying symmetry and shows that knowledge of this symmetry enables quick approximation of a highly symmetric optimization problem},

While convex clustering was originally designed for handling Euclidean distances between data points, in a growing number of applications, the data is directly characterized by a similarity matrix or weighted graph. In this paper, we extend the robust hierarchical clustering approach to these broader classes of similarities. Having defined an appropriate convex objective, the crux of this adaptation lies in our ability to provide: (a) an efficient recovery of the regularization path and (b) an empirical demonstration of the use of our method. We address the first challenge through a proximal dual algorithm, for which we characterize both the theoretical efficiency as well as the empirical performance on a set of experiments. Finally, we highlight the potential of our method by showing its application to several real-life datasets, thus providing a natural extension to the current scope of applications of convex clustering.},

  abstract    = {It is one of the most challenging problems in applied mathematics to approximatively solve high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, most of the numerical approximation schemes studied in the scientific literature suffer under the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of computational operations needed to compute an approximation with an error of size at most $ \varepsilon > 0 $ grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension $ d \in \mathbb{N} $ or in the reciprocal of $ \varepsilon $. Recently, so-called full-history recursive multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation methods have been introduced to tackle the problem of approximately solving high-dimensional PDEs. MLP approximation methods currently are, to the best of our knowledge, the only methods for parabolic semi-linear PDEs with general time horizons and general initial conditions for which there is a rigorous proof that they are indeed able to beat the curse of dimensionality. The main purpose of this work is to investigate MLP approximation methods in more depth, to reveal more clearly how these methods can overcome the curse of dimensionality, and to propose a generalised class of MLP approximation schemes, which covers previously analysed MLP approximation schemes as special cases. In particular, we develop an abstract framework in which this class of generalised MLP approximations can be formulated and analysed and, thereafter, apply this abstract framework to derive a computational complexity result for suitable MLP approximations for semi-linear heat equations. These resulting MLP approximations for semi-linear heat equations essentially are generalisations of previously introduced MLP approximations for semi-linear heat equations.},

  abstract  = {How to escape saddle points is a critical issue in nonconvex optimization. Previous methods on this issue mainly assume that the objective function is Hessian-Lipschitz, which leave a gap for applications using non-Hessian-Lipschitz functions. In this paper, we propose Cubic Regularized Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (CR-ADMM) to escape saddle points of separable non-convex functions containing a non-HessianLipschitz component. By carefully choosing a parameter, we prove that CR-ADMM converges to a local minimum of the original function with a rate of $O(\frac{1}{T} \frac{1}{3})$ in time horizon $T$, which is faster than gradient-based methods. We also show that when one or more steps of CR-ADMM are not solved exactly, CRADMM can converge to a neighborhood of the local minimum. Through the experiments of matrix factorization problems, CRADMM is shown to have a faster rate and a lower optimality gap compared with other gradient-based methods. Our approach can also find applications in other scenarios where regularized non-convex cost minimization is performed, such as parameter optimization of deep neural networks.}

  abstract  = {Matrix factorization (MF) is a versatile learning method that has found wide applications in various data-driven disciplines. Still, many MF algorithms do not adequately scale with the size of available datasets and/or lack interpretability. To improve the computational efficiency of the method, an online (streaming) MF algorithm was proposed in [1]. To enable data interpretability, a constrained version of MF, termed convex MF, was introduced in [2]. In the latter work, the basis vectors are required to lie in the convex hull of the data samples, thereby ensuring that every basis can be interpreted as a weighted combination of data samples. No current algorithmic solutions for online convex MF are known as it is challenging to find adequate convex bases without having access to the complete dataset. We address both problems by proposing the first online convex MF algorithm that maintains a collection of constant-size sets of representative data samples needed for interpreting each of the basis [2] and has the same almost sure convergence guarantees as the online learning algorithm of [1]. Our proof techniques combine random coordinate descent algorithms with specialized quasi-martingale convergence analysis. Experiments on synthetic and real world datasets show significant computational savings of the proposed online convex MF method compared to classical convex MF. Since the proposed method maintains small representative sets of data samples needed for convex interpretations, it is related to a body of work in theoretical computer science, pertaining to generating point sets [3], and in computer vision, pertaining to archetypal analysis [4]. Nevertheless, it differs from these lines of work both in terms of the objective and algorithmic implementations.}

Graphs are ubiquitous, and clustering and classification over graphs arise in diverse areas, including, e.g., image processing and social networks. Unfortunately, popular distance scores used in these applications, that scale over large graphs, are not metrics and thus come with no guarantees. Classic graph distances such as, e.g., the chemical distance and the Chartrand-Kubiki-Shultz distance are arguably natural and intuitive, and are indeed also metrics, but they are intractable: as such, their computation does not scale to large graphs. We define a broad family of graph distances, that includes both the chemical and the Chartrand-Kubiki-Shultz distances, and prove that these are all metrics. Crucially, we show that our family includes metrics that are tractable. Moreover, we extend these distances by incorporating auxiliary node attributes, which is important in practice, while maintaining both the metric property and tractability.},

  abstract  = {Spectral clustering algorithms provide approximate solutions to hard optimization problems that formulate graph partitioning in terms of the graph conductance. It is well understood that the quality of these approximate solutions is negatively affected by a possibly significant gap between the conductance and the second eigenvalue of the graph. In this paper we show that for any graph $G$, there exists a ‘spectral maximizer' graph $H$ which is cut-similar to $G$, but has eigenvalues that are near the theoretical limit implied by the cut structure of $G$. Applying then spectral clustering on $H$ has the potential to produce improved cuts that also exist in $G$ due to the cut similarity. This leads to the second contribution of this work: we describe a practical spectral modification algorithm that raises the eigenvalues of the input graph, while preserving its cuts. Combined with spectral clustering on the modified graph, this yields demonstrably improved cuts.}

Leveraging GPUs is a promising direction due to their highly parallel computing capabilities, but execution time is often hampered by write conflicts. In this paper, we present a solution to handle write conflicts in GPU computations exploiting high level of parallelism, and show how this technique can effectively be used to accelerate the computation of PageRank by a factor of 5$\times$, with respect to a baseline in which conflicts are not handled.

However, portability frameworks depend on compilers for auto-vectorization and may lack support for explicit vectorization on heterogeneous platforms. Alternatively, programmers can use intrinsics-based primitives to achieve more efficient vectorization, but the lack of a gpu back-end for these primitives makes such code non-portable. A unified, portable, Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) primitive proposed in this work, allows intrinsics-based vectorization on cpus and many-core architectures such as Intel Knights Landing (KNL), and also facilitates Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) based execution on gpus. This unified primitive, coupled with the Kokkos portability ecosystem, makes it possible to develop explicitly vectorized code, which is portable across heterogeneous platforms. The new SIMD primitive is used on different architectures to test the performance boost against hard-to-auto-vectorize baseline, to measure the overhead against efficiently vectroized baseline, and to evaluate the new feature called the “logical vector length” (LVL). The SIMD primitive provides portability across cpus and gpus without any performance degradation being observed experimentally.}

Straightforwardly porting the code often leads to a significant loss in testing accuracy. As some researchers suggested that large batch optimization leads to a low generalization performance, and they further conjectured that large-batch training needs a higher floating-point precision to achieve a higher generalization performance. To solve this problem, we conduct an open study in this paper. Our target is to find the number of bits that large-batch training needs. To do so, we need a system for customized precision study. However, state-of-the-art systems have some limitations that lower the efficiency of developers and researchers. To solve this problem, we design and implement our own system CPD: A High Performance System for Customized-Precision Distributed DL. In our experiments, our application often loses accuracy if we use a very-low precision (e.g. 8 bits or 4 bits). To solve this problem, we proposed the APS (Auto-Precision-Scaling) algorithm, which is a layer-wise adaptive scheme for gradients shifting. With APS, we are able to make the large-batch training converge with only 4 bits.},

  abstract    = {Graph sparsification underlies a large number of algorithms, ranging from approximation algorithms for cut problems to solvers for linear systems in the graph Laplacian. In its strongest form, "spectral sparsification" reduces the number of edges to near-linear in the number of nodes, while approximately preserving the cut and spectral structure of the graph. The breakthrough work by Bencz\'ur and Karger (STOC'96) and Spielman and Teng (STOC'04) showed that sparsification can be done optimally in time near-linear in the number of edges of the original graph. \\ In this work we show that quantum algorithms allow to speed up spectral sparsification, and thereby many of the derived algorithms. Given adjacency-list access to a weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, our algorithm outputs an $\epsilon$-spectral sparsifier in time $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{mn}/\epsilon)$. We prove that this is tight up to polylog-factors. The algorithm builds on a string of existing results, most notably sparsification algorithms by Spielman and Srivastava (STOC'08) and Koutis and Xu (TOPC'16), a spanner construction by Thorup and Zwick (STOC'01), a single-source shortest-paths quantum algorithm by D\"urr et al. (ICALP'04) and an efficient $k$-wise independent hash construction by Christiani, Pagh and Thorup (STOC'15). Combining our sparsification algorithm with existing classical algorithms yields the first quantum speedup, roughly from $\widetilde{O}(m)$ to $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{mn})$, for approximating the max cut, min cut, min $st$-cut, sparsest cut and balanced separator of a graph. Combining our algorithm with a classical Laplacian solver, we demonstrate a similar speedup for Laplacian solving, for approximating effective resistances, cover times and eigenvalues of the Laplacian, and for spectral clustering.},

  title       = {{SSAI}: A Symmetric Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioner for the Conjugate Gradient Method},
  institution = {Stanford University},
  date        = {2019},
  abstract    = {We propose a method for solving a Hermitian positive definite linear system $Ax = b$, where $A$ is an explicit sparse matrix (real or complex). A sparse approximate right inverse $M$ is computed and replaced by $\tilde{M} = (M + M^H)/2$, which is used as a left-right preconditioner in a modified version of the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method. M is formed column by column and can therefore be computed in parallel. PCG requires only matrix-vector multiplications with $A$ and $\tilde{M}$ (not solving a linear system with the preconditioner), and so too can be carried out in parallel. We compare it with incomplete Cholesky factorization (the gold standard for PCG) and with MATLAB's backslash operator (sparse Cholesky) on matrices from various applications.}

We employ a compartmental model for influenza transmission and formulate a mathematical program to minimize the number of vaccine doses distributed to effectively extinguish an emerging outbreak in its early stages. We propose an equity constraint to help public health authorities consider fairness when making vaccine distribution decisions. We develop an exact solution approach that generates a vaccine distribution policy with a solution quality guarantee. We perform sensitivity analyses on key epidemic parameters in order to illustrate the application of the proposed model. We then analyze the scalability of the solution approach for a population consisting of subgroups based on geographic location and age. We finally demonstrate the proposed model's ability to consider vaccine coverage inequity and discuss a derivative-free optimization approach, as an alternative solution method which can consider various different objective functions and constraints. Our results indicate that consideration of group-specific transmission dynamics is paramount to the optimal distribution of influenza vaccines.},

Some recent examples include: the squeeze-and-excitation module, depthwise separable convolutions in Xception, and the inverted bottleneck in MobileNet v2. Notably, in all of these cases, the resulting building blocks enabled not only higher efficiency, but also higher accuracy, and found wide adoption in the field. In this work, we further expand the arsenal of efficient building blocks for neural network architectures; but instead of combining standard primitives (such as convolution), we advocate for the replacement of these dense primitives with their sparse counterparts. While the idea of using sparsity to decrease the parameter count is not new, the conventional wisdom is that this reduction in theoretical FLOPs does not translate into real-world efficiency gains. We aim to correct this misconception by introducing a family of efficient sparse kernels for ARM and WebAssembly, which we open-source for the benefit of the community as part of the XNNPACK library. Equipped with our efficient implementation of sparse primitives, we show that sparse versions of MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2 and EfficientNet architectures substantially outperform strong dense baselines on the efficiency-accuracy curve. On Snapdragon 835 our sparse networks outperform their dense equivalents by $1.3-2.4\times$ -- equivalent to approximately one entire generation of MobileNet-family improvement. We hope that our findings will facilitate wider adoption of sparsity as a tool for creating efficient and accurate deep learning architectures.},

Even when the eigenvector is not completely localized, the approximate eigenvectors obtained by the greedy algorithm can be used as good starting guesses to accelerate the convergence of an iterative eigensolver applied to $H$. We discuss a few possibilities for selecting important rows and columns of $H$ and techniques for constructing good initial guesses for an iterative eigensolver using the approximate eigenvectors returned from the greedy algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with examples from nuclear quantum many-body calculations and many-body localization studies of quantum spin chains.},

In particular, we exploit zeros introduced by the ReLU activation function to both feature maps and their gradients. This is challenging because the sparsity degree is moderate and the locations of zeros change over time. We also rely purely on software. We identify zeros in a dense data representation without transforming the data and performs conventional vectorized computation. Variations of the scheme are applicable to all major components of training: forward propagation, backward propagation by inputs, and backward propagation by weights. Our method significantly outperforms a highly-optimized dense direct convolution on several popular deep neural networks. At realistic sparsity, we speed up the training of the non-initial convolutional layers in VGG16, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and Fixup ResNet-50 by 2.19$\times$, 1.37$\times$, 1.31$\times$, and 1.51$\times$ respectively on an Intel Skylake-X CPU.},

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks have revolutionized the field of machine learning by dramatically improving the state-of-the-art in various domains. The sizes of deep neural networks (DNNs) are rapidly outgrowing the capacity of hardware to fast store and train them. Over the past few decades, researches have explored the prospect of sparse DNNs before, during, and after training by pruning edges from the underlying topology. After the above operation, the generated neural network is known as a sparse neural network. More recent works have demonstrated the remarkable results that certain sparse DNNs can train to the same precision as dense DNNs at lower runtime and storage cost. Although existing methods ease the situation that high demand for computation resources severely hinders the deployment of large-scale DNNs in resource-constrained devices, DNNs can be trained at a faster speed and lower cost. In this work, we propose a Fine-tune Structured Sparsity Learning (FSSL) method to regularize the structures of DNNs and accelerate the training of DNNs. FSSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from large sparse DNN to reduce computation cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly to accelerate the DNNs evaluation efficiently. Experimental results of the training time and the compression rate show that superior performance and efficiency than the Matlab example code. These speedups are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity.},

  abstract  = {Triangle counting is a graph algorithm that calculates the number of triangles involving each vertex in a graph. Briefly, a triangle encompasses three vertices from a graph, where every vertex possesses at least one incidental edge to the other two vertices from the triangle. Consequently, list intersection, which identifies the incidental edges, becomes the core algorithm for triangle counting. At the meantime, attracted by the enormous parallel computing potential of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), numerous efforts have been devoted to deploy triangle counting algorithms on GPUs.While state-of-the-art intersection algorithms, such as merge-path and binary-search, perform well on traditional multi-core CPU systems, deploying them on massively parallel GPUs turns out to be challenging. In particular, merge-path based approach experiences the hardship of evenly distributing the workload across vast GPU threads and irregular memory accesses. Binary-search based approach often suffers from the potential problem of high time complexity. Furthermore, both approaches require sorted neighbor lists from the input graphs, which involves nontrivial preprocessing overhead. To this end, we introduce H-INDEX, a hash-indexing assisted triangle counting algorithm that overcomes all the aforementioned shortcomings. Notably, HINDEX achieves 141.399 billion TEPS computing rate on a Protein K-mer V2a graph with 64 GPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that advances triangle counting beyond the 100 billion TEPS rate.},

  abstract  = {Earth system models (ESMs) are computationally expensive and represent many complex processes on a wide range of scales from molecular to global. Certain ESM computations require high precision while others, such as atmospheric microphysics (e.g., precipitation) which are approximated by bulk properties, should not. As such, atmospheric microphysics models are prime candidates for conversion to single precision, which afford distinct computational and memory advantages over typical double-precision numbers. However, care must be taken as indiscriminate type casting to single precision can result in numerical instability and divergent output when applied naively. In this work we relate our experiences attempting to improve the performance of the Morrison-Gettelman microphysics package (MG2) in a popular ESM by modifying it to compute in single precision without sacrificing correctness. We find that modification of the entire MG2 package to compute with singleprecision floats achieves a respectable performance increase but does not appear to be correct in terms of maintaining consistency with double-precision MG2. On the other hand, narrowing the scope of our conversion to a couple expensive subprograms yields more satisfying results in terms of correctness but with negligible overall performance improvement. We evaluate correctness with both an objective statistical tool and traditional approaches more familiar to climate scientists. While we are still working toward our ultimate goal of improving the performance of MG2 without negatively affecting model output, we believe that our experiences may be helpful to other groups pursuing similar goals.}

The need for performing large scale graph analytics has led to widespread adoption of dedicated hardware accelerators such as FPGA for this purpose. In this work, we develop IP cores for several key graph kernels. Our IP cores use graph processing over partitions (GPOP) programming paradigm to perform computations over graph partitions. Partitioning the input graph into nonoverlapping partitions improves on-chip data reuse. Additional optimizations to exploit intra and interpartition parallelism and to reduce external memory accesses are also discussed. We generate FPGA designs for general graph algorithms with various vertex attributes and update propagation functions, such as Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV), PageRank (PR), Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP), and Weakly Connected Component (WCC). We target a platform consisting of large external DDR4 memory to store the graph data and Intel Stratix FPGA to accelerate the processing. Experimental results show that our accelerators sustain a high throughput of up to 2250, 2300, 3378, and 2178 Million Traversed Edges Per Second (MTEPS) for SpMV, PR, SSSP and WCC, respectively. Compared with several highly-optimized multi-core designs, our FPGA framework achieves up to 20.5$\times$ speedup for SpMV, 16.4$\times$ speedup for PR, 3.5$\times$ speedup for SSSP, and 35.1$\times$ speedup for WCC, and compared with two state-of-the-art FPGA frameworks, our designs demonstrate up to 5.3$\times$ speedup for SpMV, 1.64$\times$ speedup for PR, and 1.8$\times$ speedup for WCC, respectively.

The first part is sampled using quasi-random points and contains a finite number of terms in order of decaying importance to ensure good QMC convergence. The second part is a correction term which is sampled using standard pseudo-random numbers. We show how the sampling of both terms can be performed in linear time and memory complexity in the number of mesh cells via a supermesh construction, yielding an overall linear cost.

  abstract    = {The use of low-precision computations is popular in accelerating machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Hardware architectures, such as high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), now support native 16-bit floating-point arithmetic (i.e., half-precision). While half precision provides a natural 2$\times$/4$\times$ speedup against the performance of single/double precisions, respectively, modern GPUs are equipped with hardware accelerators that further boost the FP16 performance. These accelerators, known as tensor cores (TCs), have a theoretical peak performance that is 8$\times$/16$\times$ faster than FP32/FP64 performance, respectively. Such a high level of performance has encouraged researchers to harness the compute power of TCs outside AI applications. \\ This paper presents a mixed-precision dense linear solver ($Ax = b$) for complex matrices using the GPU's TC units. Unlike similar efforts that have discussed accelerating $Ax = b$ in real FP16 arithmetic, this paper focuses on complex FP16 precisions. The developed solution uses a “half-complex” precision to accelerate the solution of Ax = b while maintaining complex FP32 precision accuracy. The proposed solver requires the development of a high-performance mixed-precision matrix multiplication (CGEMM-FP16) that accepts half-complex inputs, and uses the TCs' full-precision products and FP32 accumulations for the computation. We discuss two designs and their performance. Similar to the way fast GEMMs power the performance of LAPACK, the mixed-precision CGEMMFP16 can enable the development of mixed-precision LAPACK algorithms. We illustrate this by integrating both CGEMM-FP16s into the development of mixed-precision LU factorizations of complex matrices. Finally, an iterative refinement solver is used to deliver complex FP32 accuracy using a preconditioned GMRES solver. Our experiments, conducted on V100 GPUs, show that the mixed-precision solver can be up to 2.5$\times$ faster than a full single-complex precision solver.}

This implementation also results in the fastest kernel time known at time of publication for real-world graphs like twitter (3.7 second) and friendster (1.8 seconds) on GPU accelerators when the graph is GPU resident. This is a 1.7 and 1.2 time improvement over previous state-of-the-art triangle counting on GPUs. We also improved end-to-end execution time by overlapping computation and communication of the graph to the GPUs. In terms of end-toend execution time, our implementation also achieves the fastest end-to-end times due to very low overhead costs.},

  abstract     = {To improve the performance of Sparse Cholesky factorization, existing research divides the adjacent columns of the sparse matrix with the same nonzero patterns into supernodes for parallelization. However, due to the various structures of sparse matrices, the computation of the generated supernodes varies significantly, and thus hard to optimize when computed by dense matrix kernels. Therefore, how to efficiently map sparse Choleksy factorization to the emerging architectures, such as Sunway many-core processor, remains an active research direction. In this paper, we propose swCholesky, which is a highly optimized implementation of sparse Cholesky factorization on Sunway processor. Specifically, we design three kernel task queues and a dense matrix library to dynamically adapt to the kernel characteristics and architecture features. In addition, we propose an auto-tuning mechanism to search for the optimal settings of the important parameters in swCholesky. Our experiments show that swCholesky achieves better performance than state-of-the-art implementations.},

In a more restrictive model where the noisy gradient estimates satisfy a mean-squared smoothness property, we prove a lower bound of $\epsilon^{-3}$ queries, establishing the optimality of recently proposed variance reduction techniques.},

  abstract    = {The Burer-Monteiro method is one of the most widely used techniques for solving large-scale semidefinite programs (SDP). The basic idea is to solve a nonconvex program in $Y$, where $Y$ is an $n \times p$ matrix such that $X = Y Y^T$. In this paper, we show that this method can solve SDPs in polynomial time in an smoothed analysis setting. More precisely, we consider an SDP whose domain satisfies some compactness and smoothness assumptions, and slightly perturb the cost matrix and the constraints. We show that if $p \gtrsim \sqrt{2(1+\eta)m}$, where $m$ is the number of constraints and $\eta>0$ is any fixed constant, then the Burer-Monteiro method can solve SDPs to any desired accuracy in polynomial time, in the setting of smooth analysis. Our bound on $p$ approaches the celebrated Barvinok-Pataki bound in the limit as $\eta$ goes to zero, beneath which it is known that the nonconvex program can be suboptimal. Previous analyses were unable to give polynomial time guarantees for the Burer-Monteiro method, since they either assumed that the criticality conditions are satisfied exactly, or ignored the nontrivial problem of computing an approximately feasible solution. We address the first problem through a novel connection with tubular neighborhoods of algebraic varieties. For the feasibility problem we consider a least squares formulation, and provide the first guarantees that do not rely on the restricted isometry property.},

  abstract    = {Model predictive control (MPC) for linear dynamical systems requires solving an optimal control structured quadratic program (QP) at each sampling instant. This paper proposes a primal active-set strategy (PRESAS) for the efficient solution of such block-sparse QPs, based on a preconditioned iterative solver to compute the search direction in each iteration. Rank-one factorization updates of the preconditioner result in a per-iteration computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N m^2)$, where $m$ denotes the number of state and control variables and $N$ the number of control intervals. Three different block-structured preconditioning techniques are presented and their numerical properties are studied further. In addition, an augmented Lagrangian based implementation is proposed to avoid a costly initialization procedure to find a primal feasible starting point. Based on a standalone C code implementation, we illustrate the computational performance of PRESAS against current state of the art QP solvers for multiple linear and nonlinear MPC case studies. We also show that the solver is real-time feasible on a dSPACE MicroAutoBox-II rapid prototyping unit for vehicle control applications, and numerical reliability is illustrated based on experimental results from a testbench of small-scale autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract  = {The solution of sparse triangular linear systems is often the most time-consuming stage of preconditioned iterative methods to solve general sparse linear systems, where it has to be applied several times for the same sparse matrix. For this reason, its computational performance has a strong impact on a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, which has motivated the study of its efficient execution on massively parallel platforms. In this sense, several methods have been proposed to tackle this operation on graphics processing units (GPUs), which can be classified under either the level-set or the self-scheduling paradigms. The results obtained from the experimental evaluation of the different methods suggest that both paradigms perform well for certain problems but poorly for others. Additionally, the relation between the properties of the linear systems and the performance of the different solvers is not evident a-priori. In this context, techniques that allow to predict inexpensively which is be the best solver for a particular linear system can lead to important runtime reductions. Our approach leverages machine learning techniques to select the best sparse triangular solver for a given linear system, with focus on the case where a small number of triangular systems has to be solved for the same matrix. We study the performance of several methods using different features derived from the sparse matrices, obtaining models with more than 80\% of accuracy and acceptable prediction speed. These results are an important advance towards the automatic selection of the best GPU solver for a given sparse triangular linear system, and the characterization of the performance of these kernels.},

  abstract  = {Technologies that improve the performance of parallel applications by increasing the nominal operating frequency of processors respecting a given TDP (Thermal Design Power) have been widely used. However, they may impact on other non-functional requirements in different ways (e.g. increasing energy consumption or aging). Therefore, considering the huge number of configurations available, represented by the range of all possible combinations among different parallel applications, amount of threads, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) governors, boosting technologies and simultaneous multithreading (SMT), selecting the one that offers the best tradeoff for a non-functional requirement is extremely challenging for software designers. Given that, in this work we assess the impact of changing these configurations on the energy consumption, performance, and aging of parallel applications on a turbo-compliant processor. Results show that there is no single configuration that would provide the best solution for all nonfunctional requirements at once. For instance, we demonstrate that the configuration that offers the best performance is the same one that has the worst impact on aging, accelerating it by up to 1.75 times. With our experiments, we provide guidelines for the developer when it comes to tuning performance using turbo boosting to save as much energy as possible and increase the lifespan of the hardware components1.1This study was financed in part by the Coordenao de Aperfeioamento de Pessoal de Nvel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001},

Multiple frameworks that achieve the best known complexity bounds among a broad class of first- and second-order strategies have been proposed. These methods have often been designed primarily with complexity guarantees in mind and, as a result, represent a departure from the algorithms that have proved to be the most effective in practice. In this paper, we consider trust-region Newton methods, one of the most popular classes of algorithms for solving nonconvex optimization problems. By introducing slight modifications to the original scheme, we obtain two methods---one based on exact subproblem solves and one exploiting inexact subproblem solves as in the popular "trust-region Newton-Conjugate-Gradient" (Newton-CG) method---with iteration and operation complexity bounds that match the best known bounds for the aforementioned class of first- and second-order methods. The resulting Newton-CG method also retains the attractive practical behavior of classical trust-region Newton-CG, which we demonstrate with numerical comparisons on a standard benchmark test set.},

The proposed techniques are obtained by incorporating the Heavy Ball Acceleration into the Iterative Hessian Sketch algorithm and they provide significant improvements over the randomized preconditioning techniques. Through the error analyses of the M-IHS variants, lower bounds on the sketch size for various randomized distributions to converge at a pre-determined rate with a constant probability are established. The bounds present the best results in the current literature for obtaining a solution approximation and they suggest that the sketch size can be chosen proportional to the statistical dimension of the regularized problem regardless of the size of the coefficient matrix. The statistical dimension is always smaller than the rank and it gets smaller as the regularization parameter increases. By using approximate solvers along with the iterations, the M-IHS variants are capable of avoiding all matrix decompositions and inversions, which is one of the main advantages over the alternative solvers such as the Blendenpik and the LSRN. Similar to the Chebyshev Semi-iterations, the M-IHS variants do not use any inner products and eliminate the corresponding synchronizations steps in hierarchical or distributed memory systems, yet the M-IHS converges faster than the Chebyshev Semi-iteration based solvers.},

  abstract    = {Social network alignment has been an important research problem for social network analysis in recent years. With the identified shared users across networks, it will provide researchers with the opportunity to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of users' social activities both within and across networks. Social network alignment is a very difficult problem. Besides the challenges introduced by the network heterogeneity, the network alignment problem can be reduced to a combinatorial optimization problem with an extremely large search space. The learning effectiveness and efficiency of existing alignment models will be degraded significantly as the network size increases. In this paper, we will focus on studying the scalable heterogeneous social network alignment problem, and propose to address it with a novel two-stage network alignment model, namely \textbf{S}calable \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{A}lignment (SHNA). Based on a group of intra- and inter-network meta diagrams, SHNA first partitions the social networks into a group of sub-networks synergistically. Via the partially known anchor links, SHNA will extract the partitioned sub-network correspondence relationships. Instead of aligning the complete input network, SHNA proposes to identify the anchor links between the matched sub-network pairs, while those between the unmatched sub-networks will be pruned to effectively shrink the search space. Extensive experiments have been done to compare SHNA with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on a real-world aligned social networks dataset. The experimental results have demonstrated both the effectiveness and efficiency of the model in addressing the problem.},

  abstract  = {Matrix powers kernel calculates the vectors Akv, for k = 1, 2,..., m and they are the heart of various scientific computations, including communication avoiding iterative solvers. In this paper we propose diamond matrix powers kernel - DMPK, which has the purpose to apply the "diamond tiling" stencil algorithm to general matrices. It can also be considered as an extension of the PA1 and PA2 algorithms, introduced by Demmel et al. Our approach enables us to control the balance between the amount of communication avoidance and redundant computation inherently present in communication avoiding algorithms. We present a proof of concept implementation of the algorithm using MPI routines. The experiments we performed show that the control of the amount of computation and communication is achievable, and with more thorough optimisations, DMPK is a promising alternative to existing MPK approaches.},

Full differentiation of the library code including MPI routines thus is avoided, and users do not need to derive their own adjoint models for their specific applications. PETSc TSAdjoint can compute the first-order derivative, that is, the gradient of a scalar functional, and the Hessian-vector product that carries second-order derivative information, while requiring minimal input (a few callbacks) from the users. Optimal checkpointing schemes are employed by the adjoint model in a manner that is transparent to users.

  abstract    = {In many modern imaging applications the desire to reconstruct high resolution images, coupled with the abundance of data from acquisition using ultra-fast detectors, have led to new challenges in image reconstruction. A main challenge is that the resulting linear inverse problems are massive. The size of the forward model matrix exceeds the storage capabilities of computer memory, or the observational dataset is enormous and not available all at once. Row-action methods that iterate over samples of rows can be used to approximate the solution while avoiding memory and data availability constraints. However, their overall convergence can be slow. In this paper, we introduce a sampled limited memory row-action method for linear least squares problems, where an approximation of the global curvature of the underlying least squares problem is used to speed up the initial convergence and to improve the accuracy of iterates. We show that this limited memory method is a generalization of the damped block Kaczmarz method, and we prove linear convergence of the expectation of the iterates and of the error norm up to a convergence horizon. Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits of these sampled limited memory row-action methods for massive 2D and 3D inverse problems in tomography applications.},

Given a function $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that is convex and twice-continuously differentiable, we study an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that is governed by the gradient operator $\nabla \Phi$ and a positive control parameter $\lambda(t)$ that tends to infinity as $t \rightarrow +\infty$. The tuning of $\lambda(\cdot)$ is achieved via a closed-loop control law based on the \textit{algebraic equation} $[\lambda(t)]^p\|\nabla\Phi(x(t))\|^{p-1} = \theta$ for a given $\theta > 0$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a local solution to this closed-loop ODE by the Banach fixed-point theorem. We then present a Lyapunov function that allows us to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global solution and analyze the convergence properties of trajectories. The rate of convergence is $\mathcal{O}(t^{-(3p+1)/2})$ in terms of objective gap and $\mathcal{O}(t^{-3p})$ in terms of squared gradient norm. We present two frameworks for implicit time discretization of the ODE, one of which generalizes the \textsf{large-step A-HPE} framework of~[Monteiro2013], and the other of which leads to a new $p$-th order tensor algorithm. A highlight of our analysis is that we show that all of the $p$-th order optimal tensor algorithms in this paper minimize the squared gradient norm at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(k^{-3p})$.},

This framework is developed in Pytorch, and it enables distributed-memory execution on cloud or supercomputer systems. PyHessian enables fast computations of the top Hessian eigenvalue, the Hessian trace, and the full Hessian eigenvalue density. This general framework can be used to analyze neural network models, including the topology of the loss landscape (i.e., curvature information) to gain insight into the behavior of different models/optimizers. To illustrate this, we apply PyHessian to analyze the effect of residual connections and Batch Normalization layers on the smoothness of the loss landscape. One recent claim, based on simpler first-order analysis, is that residual connections and batch normalization make the loss landscape ``smoother'', thus making it easier for Stochastic Gradient Descent to converge to a good solution. We perform an extensive analysis by measuring directly the Hessian spectrum using PyHessian. This analysis leads to finer-scale insight, demonstrating that while conventional wisdom is sometimes validated, in other cases it is simply incorrect. In particular, we find that batch normalization layers do not necessarily make the loss landscape smoother, especially for shallow networks. Instead, the claimed smoother loss landscape only becomes evident for deep neural networks. We perform extensive experiments on four residual networks (ResNet20/32/38/56) on Cifar-10/100 dataset. We have open-sourced our PyHessian framework for Hessian spectrum computation.},

  abstract    = {In this paper, we study the lower iteration complexity bounds for finding the saddle point of a strongly convex and strongly concave saddle point problem: $\min_x\max_yF(x,y)$. We restrict the classes of algorithms in our investigation to be either pure first-order methods or methods using proximal mappings. The existing lower bound result for this type of problems is obtained via the framework of strongly monotone variational inequality problems, which corresponds to the case where the gradient Lipschitz constants ($L_x, L_y$ and $L_{xy}$) and strong convexity/concavity constants ($\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$) are uniform with respect to variables $x$ and $y$. However, specific to the min-max saddle point problem these parameters are naturally different. Therefore, one is led to finding the best possible lower iteration complexity bounds, specific to the min-max saddle point models. In this paper we present the following results. For the class of pure first-order algorithms, our lower iteration complexity bound is $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_x}{\mu_x}+\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}+\frac{L_y}{\mu_y}}\cdot\ln\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$, where the term $\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}$ explains how the coupling influences the iteration complexity. Under several special parameter regimes, this lower bound has been achieved by corresponding optimal algorithms. However, whether or not the bound under the general parameter regime is optimal remains open. Additionally, for the special case of bilinear coupling problems, given the availability of certain proximal operators, a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{L_{xy}^2}{\mu_x\mu_y}+1}\cdot\ln(\frac{1}{\epsilon})\right)$ is established in this paper, and optimal algorithms have already been developed in the literature.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the field of machine learning has seen significant advances as data becomes more abundant and deep learning models become larger and more complex. However, these improvements in accuracy [2] have come at the cost of longer training time. As a result, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's GPT-2 [18] or AlphaZero [20] require the use of distributed systems or clusters in order to speed up training. Currently, there exist both asynchronous and synchronous solvers for distributed training. In this paper, we implement state-of-the-art asynchronous and synchronous solvers, then conduct a comparison between them to help readers pick the most appropriate solver for their own applications. We address three main challenges: (1) implementing asynchronous solvers that can outperform six common algorithm variants, (2) achieving state-of-the-art distributed performance for various applications with different computational patterns, and (3) maintaining accuracy for large-batch asynchronous training. For asynchronous algorithms, we implement an algorithm called EA-wild, which combines the idea of non-locking wild updates from Hogwild! [19] with EASGD. Our implementation is able to scale to 217,600 cores and finish 90 epochs of training the ResNet-50 model on ImageNet in 15 minutes (the baseline takes 29 hours on eight NVIDIA P100 GPUs). We conclude that more complex models (e.g., ResNet-50) favor synchronous methods, while our asynchronous solver outperforms the synchronous solver for models with a low computation-communication ratio. The results are documented in this paper; for more results, readers can refer to our supplemental website 1.},

However, three key challenges must be addressed: existing automated tools are difficult to compose due to subtle incompatibilities; there is no “gold standard” for correct MPMF execution; and no methodology exists for generalizing existing, IEEE-754-specialized tools to support MPMF. In this paper we report on recent work towards mitigating these related challenges. First, we extend the FPBench standard to support multi-precision, multi-format (MPMF) applications.

Consequently, many algorithms have been developed to minimize the number of I/O operations for common computing patterns. Matrix multiplication is no exception, and lower bounds have been proven and implemented both for shared and distributed memory systems. Reconfigurable hardware platforms are a lucrative target for I/O minimizing algorithms, as they offer full control of memory accesses to the programmer. While bounds developed in the context of fixed architectures still apply to these platforms, the spatially distributed nature of their computational and memory resources requires a decentralized approach to optimize algorithms for maximum hardware utilization. We present a model to optimize matrix multiplication for FPGA platforms, simultaneously targeting maximum performance and minimum off-chip data movement, within constraints set by the hardware. We map the model to a concrete architecture using a high-level synthesis tool, maintaining a high level of abstraction, allowing us to support arbitrary data types, and enables maintainability and portability across FPGA devices. Kernels generated from our architecture are shown to offer competitive performance in practice, scaling with both compute and memory resources. We offer our design as an open source project to encourage the open development of linear algebra and I/O minimizing algorithms on reconfigurable hardware platforms.},

This work evaluates irregular algorithms that could benefit from the lightweight, memory-side processing of the Chick and demonstrates techniques and optimization strategies for achieving performance in sparse matrix-vector multiply operation (SpMV), breadth-first search (BFS), and graph alignment across up to eight distributed nodes encompassing 64 nodelets in the Chick system.

These enriched interpolating conditions form then an affine space of model Hessians or model Newton directions, from which a particular one can be computed once an equilibrium or least secant principle is defined. A first approach consists of recovering the Hessian matrix satisfying the enriched interpolating conditions, from which then a Newton direction model can be computed. In a second approach we pose the recovery problem directly in the Newton direction. These techniques can lead to a significant reduction in the overall number of Hessian-vector products when compared to the inexact or truncated Newton method, although simple implementations may pay a cost in linear algebra or number of function evaluations.},

We first provide a concise and relatively self-contained review of the HFB theory for general finite sized quantum systems, with special focus on the treatment of spin symmetries from a linear algebra perspective. We then demonstrate that the pole expansion and selected inversion (PEXSI) method can be particularly well suited for solving large scale HFB equations. For a Hubbard-type Hamiltonian, the cost of PEXSI is at most $O(N_b^2)$ for both gapped and gapless systems, which can be significantly faster than the standard cubic scaling diagonalization methods. We show that PEXSI can solve a two-dimensional Hubbard-Hofstadter model with $N_b$ up to $2.88\times 10^6$, and the wall clock time is less than $100$ s using $17280$ CPU cores. This enables the simulation of physical systems under experimentally realizable magnetic fields, which cannot be otherwise simulated with smaller systems.},

  abstract    = {For many data-intensive real-world applications, such as recognizing objects from images, detecting spam emails, and recommending items on retail websites, the most successful current approaches involve learning rich prediction rules from large datasets. There are many challenges in these machine learning tasks. For example, as the size of the datasets and the complexity of these prediction rules increase, there is a significant challenge in designing scalable methods that can effectively exploit the availability of distributed computing units. As another example, in many machine learning applications, there can be data corruptions, communication errors, and even adversarial attacks during training and test. Therefore, to build reliable machine learning models, we also have to tackle the challenge of robustness in machine learning. \\ In this dissertation, we study several topics on the scalability and robustness in large-scale learning, with a focus of establishing solid theoretical foundations for these problems, and demonstrate recent progress towards the ambitious goal of building more scalable and robust machine learning models. We start with the speedup saturation problem in distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms with large mini-batches. We introduce the notion of gradient diversity, a metric of the dissimilarity between concurrent gradient updates, and show its key role in the convergence and generalization performance of mini-batch SGD. We then move forward to Byzantine distributed learning, a topic that involves both scalability and robustness in distributed learning. In the Byzantine setting that we consider, a fraction of distributed worker machines can have arbitrary or even adversarial behavior. We design statistically and computationally efficient algorithms to defend against Byzantine failures in distributed optimization with convex and non-convex objectives. Lastly, we discuss the adversarial example phenomenon. We provide theoretical analysis of the adversarially robust generalization properties of machine learning models through the lens of Radamacher complexity.}

  abstract = {We study the circle-circle non-overlapping constraints, a form of reverse convex constraints that often arise in optimization models for cutting and packing applications. The feasible region induced by the intersection of circle-circle non-overlapping constraints is highly non-convex, and standard approaches to construct convex relaxations for spatial branch-and-bound global optimization of such models typically yield unsatisfactory loose relaxations. Consequently, solving such non-convex models to guaranteed optimality remains extremely challenging even for the state-of-the-art codes. In this paper, we apply a purpose-built branching scheme on non-overlapping constraints and utilize strengthened intersection cuts and various feasibility-based tightening techniques to further tighten the model relaxation. We embed these techniques into a branch-and-bound code and test them on two variants of circle packing problems. Our computational studies on a suite of 75 benchmark instances yielded, for the first time in the open literature, a total of 54 provably optimal solutions, and it was demonstrated to be competitive over the use of the state-of-the-art general-purpose global optimization solvers.}

There are two fundamentally different concepts to generate valid global constraints from infeasible subproblems. The first is to analyze the sequence of implications, obtained by domain propagation, that led to infeasibility. The result of this analysis is one or more sets of contradicting variable bounds from which so-called conflict constraints can be generated. This concept is called conflict graph analysis and has its origin in solving satisfiability problems and is similarly used in constraint programming. The second concept is to analyze infeasible linear programming (LP) relaxations. Every ray of the dual LP provides a set of multipliers that can be used to generate a single new globally valid linear constraint. This method is called dual proof analysis. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we present three enhancements of dual proof analysis: presolving via variable cancellation, strengthening by applying mixed integer rounding functions, and a filtering mechanism. Further, we provide an intense computational study evaluating the impact of every presented component regarding dual proof analysis. Secondly, this paper presents the first integrated approach to use both conflict graph and dual proof analysis simultaneously within a single MIP solution process. All experiments are carried out on general MIP instances from the standard public test set MIPLIB 2017; the presented algorithms have been implemented within the non-commercial MIP solver SCIP and the commercial MIP solver FICO Xpress.}

  abstract    = {Conflict learning plays an important role in solving mixed integer programs (MIPs) and is implemented in most major MIP solvers. A major step for MIP conflict learning is to aggregate the LP relaxation of an infeasible subproblem to a single globally valid constraint, the dual proof, that proves infeasibility within the local bounds. Among others, one way of learning is to add these constraints to the problem formulation for the remainder of the search. We suggest to not restrict this procedure to infeasible subproblems, but to also use global proof constraints from subproblems that are not (yet) infeasible, but can be expected to be pruned soon. As a special case, we also consider learning from integer feasible LP solutions. First experiments of this conflict-free learning strategy show promising results on the MIPLIB2017 benchmark set.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {We describe the automatic Benders decomposition implemented in the commercial solver IBM CPLEX. We propose several improvements to the state-of-the-art along two lines: making a numerically robust method able to deal with the general case and improving the efficiency of the method on models amenable to decomposition. For the former, we deal with: unboundedness, failures in generating cuts and scaling of the artificial variable representing the objective. For the latter, we propose a new technique to handle so-called generalized bound constraints and we use different types of normalization conditions in the Cut Generating LPs. We present computational experiments aimed at assessing the importance of the various enhancements. In particular, on our test bed of models amenable to a decomposition, our implementation is approximately 5 times faster than CPLEX default branch-and-cut. A remarkable result is that, on the same test bed, default branch-and-cut is faster than a Benders decomposition that doesn't implement our improvements.}

  abstract    = {Since the elimination algorithm of Fourier and Motzkin, many different methods have been developed for solving linear programs. When analyzing the time complexity of LP algorithms, it is typically either assumed that calculations are performed exactly and bounds are derived on the number of elementary arithmetic operations necessary, or the cost of all arithmetic operations is considered through a bit-complexity analysis. Yet in practice, implementations typically use limited-precision arithmetic. In this paper we introduce the idea of a limited-precision LP oracle and study how such an oracle could be used within a larger framework to compute exact precision solutions to LPs. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that a polynomial number of calls to such an oracle and a polynomial number of bit operations, is sufficient to compute an exact solution to an LP. This work provides a foundation for understanding and analyzing the behavior of the methods that are currently most effective in practice for solving LPs exactly.}

Scheduling on such hybrid platforms is a challenging problem since the algorithms used for the case of homogeneous resources do not adapt well. In this paper we consider the problem of scheduling a set of tasks subject to precedence constraints on hybrid platforms, composed of two types of processing units. We propose a $(3+2\sqrt{2})$-approximation algorithm and a conditional lower bound of 3 on the approximation ratio. These results improve upon the 6-approximation algorithm proposed by Kedad-Sidhoum et al. as well as the lower bound of 2 due to Svensson for identical machines. Our algorithm is inspired by the former one and distinguishes the allocation and the scheduling phases. However, we propose a different allocation procedure which, although is less efficient for the allocation sub-problem, leads to an improved approximation ratio for the whole scheduling problem. This approximation ratio actually decreases when the number of processing units of each type is close and matches the conditional lower bound when they are equal.},

The definition of atomic set is very broad; popular examples include the standard basis, low-rank matrices, overcomplete dictionaries, permutation matrices, orthogonal matrices, etc. The model of sparse atomic optimization therefore includes problems coming from many fields, including statistics, signal processing, machine learning, computer vision and so on. Specifically, we consider the problem of maximizing a restricted strongly convex (or concave), smooth function restricted to a sparse linear combination of atoms. We extend recent work that establish linear convergence rates of greedy algorithms on restricted strongly concave, smooth functions on sparse vectors to the realm of general atomic sets, where the convergence rate involves a novel quantity: the "sparse atomic condition number". This leads to the strongest known multiplicative approximation guarantees for various flavors of greedy algorithms for sparse atomic optimization; in particular, we show that in many settings of interest the greedy algorithm can attain strong approximation guarantees while maintaining sparsity. Furthermore, we introduce a scheme for forward-backward algorithms that achieves the same approximation guarantees. Secondly, we define an alternate notion of weak submodularity, which we show is tightly related to the more familiar version that has been used to prove earlier linear convergence rates. We prove analogous multiplicative approximation guarantees using this alternate weak submodularity, and establish its distinct identity and applications.},

All these implementations are part of the first prototype of sLASs library, a novel library for auto-tunable codes for linear algebra operations based on LASs library. In all these cases, the use of the OmpSs-2 features presents an improvement in terms of execution time against other reference libraries such as, the original LASs library, PLASMA, ATLAS and Intel MKL. These codes are able to reduce the execution time in about 18\% on big matrices, by increasing the IPC on gemm and reducing the time of task instantiation. For a few medium matrices, benefits are also seen. For small matrices and a subset of medium matrices, specific optimizations that allow to increase the degree of parallelism in both, gemm and trsm tasks, are applied. This strategy achieves an increment in performance of up to 40\%.},

We introduce a generalized linear independence constraint qualification (GLICQ) criterion and prove that any GLICQ regular point that is sufficiently close to the feasible set can be used to construct an appropriate penalty term and recover a feasible solution. As a consequence, we describe a heuristic sequential procedure that preserves feasibility and aims to improve the  bjective value at each iteration. Numerical experiments on large-scale system identification problems as well as benchmark instances from the library of quadratic programming (QPLIB) demonstrate the ability of the proposed penalized semidefinite programs in finding near-optimal solutions for non-convex QCQP.}

Our work focuses on an efficient distributed-memory parallelization of an accurate single-node algorithm for overlapping and aligning long reads. We achieve scalability of this irregular algorithm by addressing the competing issues of increasing parallelism, minimizing communication, constraining the memory footprint, and ensuring good load balance. The resulting application, diBELLA, is the first distributed memory overlapper and aligner specifically designed for long reads and parallel scalability.

If the complicating constraints are removed, the problem becomes easy to solve, e.g. due to decomposable structure. Integrality of the linking variables allows us to apply a discretization approach to derive a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation and solve the problem to global optimality using branch-and-price. It is a remarkably simple idea; but to our surprise, it has barely found any application in the literature. In this work, we show that many relevant problems directly fall or can be reformulated into this class of MINLPs.

Two approaches are considered: a hybrid matrix-based scheme where the convective Jacobian is constructed explicitly; and a matrix-free method using reverse-mode automatic differentiation. The hybrid matrix-based scheme exploits a compact convective stencil using graph colouring to evaluate the convective Jacobian terms in $O(10)$ residual evaluations. Jacobian terms, grouped by colours, are evaluated using the complex step tangent model; this approach requires no external libraries or tools, minimal code modification and provides derivatives accurate to machine precision. The remaining artificial dissipation terms are trivial to differentiate by hand where the sensor coefficients are held constant. The hybrid matrix-based methodology is validated and compared with the `traditional` matrix-free approach using reverse-mode automatic differentiation. The adjoint equations using both approaches are solved using the same fixed-point Runge-Kutta iteration accelerated by agglomeration multigrid. No loss in accuracy is seen between the matrix-based and the matrix-free methods when validated with the complex step tangent model. The hybrid matrix-based approach demonstrates a notable runtime performance advantage over the traditional matrix-free approach due to the prior calculation of Jacobian terms. Moreover, the convective Jacobian calculation takes less than $5\%$ of primal runtime due to the compact stencil used. A critical analysis of the results and methodology is consequently presented, focusing on the general applicability of the hybrid approach to more complex problems.}

The design of the experiments focuses on the sensitivity of the applications to rather different patterns of task location, to assess the impact on the cluster performance. The accomplished weak-scaling tests stress the effect of the MPI-based application mappings (concentrated vs. distributed patterns of MPI tasks over the nodes) on the cluster. Results reveal that highly distributed task patterns may imply a much larger execution time in scale, when several hundreds or thousands of MPI tasks are involved in the experiments. Such a characterization serves users to carry out further, more efficient executions. Also researchers may use these experiments to improve their scalability simulators.

We developed highly optimized implementations which can achieve performance close to the upper bound performance. From our evaluation on Titan V, a Volta architecture GPU, we made the following observations: as the Dot2 operation consumes 11 times binary64 instructions, GEMM requires the corresponding overheads (in terms of both execution time and energy consumption), compared to the standard binary64 implementation. On the other hand, the accuracy of DOT, GEMV, and CSRMV is improved with a very small overhead to the execution time and up to roughly 30\% overhead to the energy requirement.},

  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {Solving mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems (MINLPs) to global optimality is extremely challenging. An important step for enabling their solution consists in the design of convex relaxations of the feasible set. Known solution approaches based on spatial branch-and-bound become more effective the tighter the used relaxations are. Relaxations are commonly established by convex underestimators, where each constraint function is considered separately. Instead, a considerably tighter relaxation can be found via so-called simultaneous convexification, where convex underestimators are derived for more than one constraint at a time. In this work, we present a global solution approach for solving mixed-integer nonlinear problems that uses simultaneous convexification. We introduce a separation method for the convex hull of constrained sets. It relies on determining the convex envelope of linear combinations of the constraints and on solving a nonsmooth convex problem. In particular, we apply the method to quadratic absolute value functions and derive their convex envelopes. The practicality of the proposed solution approach is demonstrated on several test instances from gas network optimization, where the method outperforms standard approaches that use separate convex relaxations.}

  abstract  = {Linear algebra algorithms are used widely in a variety of domains, e.g machine learning, numerical physics and video games graphics. For all these applications, loop-level parallelism is required to achieve high performance. However, finding the optimal way to schedule the workload between threads is a non-trivial problem because it depends on the structure of the algorithm being parallelized and the hardware the executable is run on. In the realm of Asynchronous Many Task runtime systems, a key aspect of the scheduling problem is predicting the proper chunk-size, where the chunk-size is defined as the number of iterations of a for-loop are assigned to a thread as one task. In this paper, we study the applications of supervised learning models to predict the chunk-size which yields maximum performance on multiple parallel linear algebra operations using the HPX backend of Blaze's linear algebra library. More precisely, we generate our training and tests sets by measuring performance of the application with different chunk-sizes for multiple linear algebra operations; vector-addition, matrix-vector-multiplication, matrix-matrix addition and matrix-matrix-multiplication. We compare the use of logistic regression, neural networks and decision trees with a newly developed decision tree based model in order to predict the optimal value for chunk-size. Our results show that classical decision trees and our custom decision tree model are able to forecast a chunk-size which results in good performance for the linear algebra operations.}

  abstract   = {The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method is often employed for the solution of linear systems of equations arising in numerical simulations of physical phenomena. While being widely used, the solver is also known for its lack of accuracy while computing the residual. In this article, we propose two algorithmic solutions that originate from the ExBLAS project to enhance the accuracy of the solver as well as to ensure its reproducibility in a hybrid MPI + OpenMP tasks programming environment. One is based on ExBLAS and preserves every bit of information until the final rounding, while the other relies upon floating-point expansions and, hence, expands the intermediate precision. Instead of converting the entire solver into its ExBLAS-related implementation, we identify those parts that violate reproducibility/non-associativity, secure them, and combine this with the sequential executions. These algorithmic strategies are reinforced with programmability suggestions to assure deterministic executions. Finally, we verify these approaches on two modern HPC systems: both versions deliver reproducible number of iterations, residuals, direct errors, and vector-solutions for the overhead of less than 37.7 \% on 768 cores.},

  abstract    = {This paper shows how to generate code that efficiently converts sparse tensors between disparate storage formats (data layouts) like CSR, DIA, ELL, and many others. We decompose sparse tensor conversion into three logical phases: coordinate remapping, analysis, and assembly. We then develop a language that precisely describes how different formats group together and order a tensor's nonzeros in memory. This enables a compiler to emit code that performs complex reorderings (remappings) of nonzeros when converting between formats. We additionally develop a query language that can extract complex statistics about sparse tensors, and we show how to emit efficient analysis code that computes such queries. Finally, we define an abstract interface that captures how data structures for storing a tensor can be efficiently assembled given specific statistics about the tensor. Disparate formats can implement this common interface, thus letting a compiler emit optimized sparse tensor conversion code for arbitrary combinations of a wide range of formats without hard-coding for any specific one. Our evaluation shows that our technique generates sparse tensor conversion routines with performance between 0.99 and 2.2$\times$ that of hand-optimized implementations in two widely used sparse linear algebra libraries, SPARSKIT and Intel MKL. By emitting code that avoids materializing temporaries, our technique also outperforms both libraries by between 1.4 and 3.4$\times$ for CSC/COO to DIA/ELL conversion.},

In this way, we are able to tackle cases beyond the Lipschitz framework provided by a global norm, and we derive optimal regret bounds and last iterate convergence results through the use of regularized learning methods (such as online mirror descent).

  abstract = {In a Hilbert space H, we develop fast convex optimization methods, which are based on a third order in time evolution system. The function to minimize $f : \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is convex, continuously differentiable, with $\text{argmin} f \neq \emptyset$, and enters the dynamic via its gradient. On the basis of Lyapunov's analysis and temporal scaling techniques, we show a convergence rate of the values of the order $\nicefrac{1}{t^3}$ , and obtain the convergence of the trajectories towards optimal solutions. When $f$ is strongly convex, an exponential rate of convergence is obtained. We complete the study of the continuous dynamic by introducing a damping term induced by the Hessian of $f$. This allows the oscillations to be controlled and attenuated. Then, we analyze the convergence of the proximal-based algorithms obtained by temporal discretization of this system, and obtain similar convergence rates. The algorithmic results are valid for a general convex, lower semicontinuous, and proper function $f : \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \cup \{ +\infty \}$.}

In this article, the classical conjugate gradient algorithms targeting at sparse linear system $Ax = b$ in Krylov subspace are pipelining to execute interdependent tasks on Parallel Runtime Scheduling and Execution Controller (PaRSEC) runtime. Firstly, the sparse matrix $A$ is split in rows to unfold more coarse-grained parallelism. Secondly, the partitioned sub-vectors are not assembled into one full vector in RAM to run sparse matrix--vector product (SpMV) operations for eliminating the communication overhead. Moreover, in the SpMV computation, if all elements of one column in the split sub-matrix are zeros, the corresponding product operations of these elements may be removed by reorganizing sub-vectors. Finally, the latency of migrating sub-vector is partially overlapped by the duration of performing SpMV operations through the further splitting in columns of sparse matrix on GPUs. In experiments, a series of tests demonstrate that optimal speedup and higher pipelining efficiency has been achieved for the pipelined task scheduling on PaRSEC runtime. Fusing SpMV concurrency and dot product pipelining can achieve higher speedup and efficiency.},

A library of interpolation-based modelling tools is also described, which can be associated to the structured or unstructured versions of the initial BFO pattern search algorithm. The use of the library further enhances performance, especially when associated with structure. The significant gains in performance associated with these two techniques are illustrated using a new freely-available release of BFO which incorporates them. A interesting conclusion of the results presented is that providing global structural information on a problem can result in significantly less evaluations of the objective function than attempting to building local Taylor-like models.},

A possibility to reduce the makespan is to aggregate the tasks to make them heavier, while having fewer of them, with the objective of mitigating the importance of the overhead. In this paper, we study an existing clustering/partitioning strategy to speed up the parallel execution of a task-based application. We provide two additional heuristics to this algorithm and perform an in-depth study on a large graph set. In addition, we propose a new model to estimate the execution duration and use it to choose the proper granularity.

Therefore, this paper studies the multi-view clustering problem, which aims to divide data points into several groups using multiple features. However, existing multi-view clustering methods fail to capturing the grouping effect and local geometrical structure of the multiple features. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel multi-view subspace clustering model called graph-regularized least squares regression (GLSR), which uses not only the least squares regression instead of the nuclear norm to generate grouping effect, but also the manifold constraint to preserve the local geometrical structure of multiple features. Specifically, the proposed GLSR method adopts the least squares regression to learn the globally consensus information shared by multiple views and the column-sparsity norm to measure the residual information. Under the alternating direction method of multipliers framework, an effective method is developed by iteratively update all variables. Numerical studies on eight real databases demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed GLSR over eleven state-of-the-art methods.},

In particular, the tile low-rank (TLR) Cholesky factorization represents one of the most critical matrix operations toward solving challenging large-scale scientific applications. The challenge resides in the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the various computational kernels, which stresses PaRSE's dynamic engine when orchestrating the task executions at runtime. Such irregular workload imposes the deployment of new scheduling heuristics to privilege the critical path, while exposing task parallelism to maximize hardware occupancy. To measure the effectiveness of PaRSE's engine and its various scheduling strategies for tackling such workloads, it becomes paramount to implement adequate performance analysis and profiling tools tailored to fine-grained and heterogeneous task execution. This permits us not only to provide insights from PaRSE, but also to identify potential applications' performance bottlenecks. These instrumentation tools may actually foster synergism between applications and PaRSE developers for productivity as well as high-performance computing purposes. We demonstrate the benefits of these amenable tools, while assessing the performance of TLR Cholesky factorization from data distribution, communication-reducing and synchronization-reducing perspectives. This tool-assisted performance analysis results in three major contributions: a new hybrid data distribution, a new hierarchical TLR Cholesky algorithm, and a new performance model for tuning the tile size. The new TLR Cholesky factorization achieves an 8X performance speedup over existing implementations on massively parallel supercomputers, toward solving large-scale 3D climate and weather prediction applications.}

Experimental performance results show that the proposed reduction method is $\sim 3.2 \times$ faster than a conventional GPU reduction implementation, and preserves the numerical precision because the sub-results of each chain of $R$ MMAs is kept as a 32-bit floating point value, before being all reduced into as a final 32-bit result.

The graph is represented by a weighted adjacency matrix $A$ that, in GSP, generalizes the Discrete Signal Processing (DSP) shift operator $z^{-1}$. The (right) eigenvectors of the shift $A$ (graph spectral components) diagonalize $A$ and lead to a graph Fourier basis $F$ that provides a graph spectral representation of the graph signal. The inverse of the (matrix of the) graph Fourier basis $F$ is the Graph Fourier transform (GFT), $F^{-1}$. Often, including in real world examples, this diagonalization is numerically unstable. This paper develops an approach to compute an accurate approximation to $F$ and $F^{-1}$, while insuring their numerical stability, by means of solving a non convex optimization problem. To address the non-convexity, we propose an algorithm, the stable graph Fourier basis algorithm (SGFA) that we prove to exponentially increase the accuracy of the approximating $F$ per iteration. Likewise, we can apply SGFA to $A^H$ and, hence, approximate the stable left eigenvectors for the graph shift $A$ and directly compute the GFT. We evaluate empirically the quality of SGFA by applying it to graph shifts $A$ drawn from two real world problems, the 2004 US political blogs graph and the Manhattan road map, carrying out a comprehensive study on tradeoffs between different SGFA parameters. We also confirm our conclusions by applying SGFA on very sparse and very dense directed Erd\H os-R\'enyi graphs.},

If the objective is assumed to be convex, the iteration complexity is improved to $O(n\epsilon^{-1} )$. If, in addition, the objective is strongly convex (relative to the reference function), the global linear convergence rate is recovered. We also present the accelerated version of the RBCD method, which attains an $O(n\varepsilon^{-1/\gamma} )$ iteration complexity for the convex case, where the scalar $\gamma\in [1,2]$ is determined by the \textit{generalized translation variant} of the Bregman distance. Convergence analysis without assuming the global Lipschitz-continuous (partial) gradient sets our results apart from the existing works in the composite problems.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {We present parallelization and linearization schemes for improving state-of-the-art algorithms for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs). Recently, shared-memory multicore computing systems are quite prevalent and one can effectively harness the available computing resources. On this front, we first present parallel extensions of the tree based algorithms in the MINLP solver MINOTAUR, the nonlinear branch-and-bound (NLP-BB) and the LP/NLP based branch-andbound (QG). Next, we deploy several linearization techniques to obtain tighter relaxations in QG. Adding cuts only at integer feasible points in the branch-and-cut framework of QG may lead to large trees. First, we describe methods based on primal and dual information at the nodes to detect appropriate conditions for adding more inequalities. Next, we describe methods to generate tight inequalities by exploiting specific structures in the nonlinear constraint functions using iterative solution of LP and NLP relaxations in some neighbourhood of the root NLP solution. Third, we present line search based methods for finding good points for generating linear inequalities when this structure is missing.\\ We benchmark our improvised algorithms with two parallel extensions of outer-approximation (OA) algorithm implemented in MINOTAUR that deploy a multi-threaded mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver. The first extension executes the MILPs within OA in parallel. Recently, some MILP solvers allow the calling programs to pass problem specific information like cuts, solutions etc. during their tree-search through callback functions. Using this (lazy cuts callback) functionality, we implement a second variant, which can also be viewed as a parallel QG algorithm primarily managed by the MILP solver (LSTOA). We present extensive computational experiments to show the encouraging individual and combined effects of parallelization and linearization techniques on the tree-based algorithms and analyze their performance alongside MILP based algorithms.}

State-of-the-art methods efficiently solve the problem in case of torque-controlled rigid robots via a translation of the optimal control problem into a convex optimization problem. Recently, we showed that, for jerk-controlled rigid robots, the problem could be recast into a non-convex optimization problem. The non-convexity is given by bilinear constraints that can be efficiently handled through McCormick relaxations and spatial Branch-and-Bound techniques. In this paper, we show that, even in case of robots with flexible joints, the time-optimal trajectory planning problem can be recast into a non-convex problem in which the non-convexity is still given by bilinear constraints. We performed experimental tests on a planar 2R elastic manipulator to validate the benefits of the proposed approach. The scalability of the method for robots with multiple degrees of freedom is also discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we implement and evaluate a one-sided communication-based distributed-memory sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV).

One-sided communication paradigms enjoy higher effective network bandwidth and lower synchronization costs compared to their two-sided counterparts. We use a passive target mode in one-sided communication to implement a synchronizationfree task queue to manage the messaging between producerconsumer pairs. Whereas some numerical methods lend themselves to simple performance analysis, the DAG-based computational graph of SpTRSV demands we construct a critical path performance model in order to assess our observed performance relative to machine capabilities. In alignment with our model, our foMPI-based one-sided implementation of SpTRSV reduces communication time by 1.5$\times$ to 2.5$\times$ and improves SpTRSV solver performance by up to 2.4$\times$ compared to the SuperLU DIST's two-sided MPI implementation running on 64 to 4,096 processes on Cray supercomputers.}

Our recent probabilistic error analysis, which assumes rounding errors to be independent random variables [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 41 (2019), pp. A2815–A2835], contains smaller constants but its bounds can still be pessimistic. We perform a new probabilistic error analysis that assumes both the data and the rounding errors to be random variables and assumes only mean independence. We prove that for data with zero or small mean we can relax the existing probabilistic bounds of order $sqrt{n}u$ to much sharper bounds of order $u$, which are independent of $n$. Our fundamental result is for summation and we use it to derive results for inner products, matrix–vector products, and matrix–matrix products. The analysis answers the open question of why random data distributed on $[-1, 1]$ leads to smaller error growth for these kernels than random data distributed on $[0, 1]$. We also propose a new algorithm for multiplying two matrices that transforms the rows of the first matrix to have zero mean and we show that it can achieve significantly more accurate results than standard matrix multiplication.}

  abstract     = {The extrapolation strategy raised by Nesterov, which can accelerate the convergence rate of gradient descent methods by orders of magnitude when dealing with smooth convex objective, has led to tremendous success in training machine learning tasks. In this article, the convergence of individual iterates of projected subgradient (PSG) methods for nonsmooth convex optimization problems is theoretically studied based on Nesterov's extrapolation, which we name individual convergence. We prove that Nesterov's extrapolation has the strength to make the individual convergence of PSG optimal for nonsmooth problems. In light of this consideration, a direct modification of the subgradient evaluation suffices to achieve optimal individual convergence for strongly convex problems, which can be regarded as making an interesting step toward the open question about stochastic gradient descent (SGD) posed by Shamir. Furthermore, we give an extension of the derived algorithms to solve regularized learning tasks with nonsmooth losses in stochastic settings. Compared with other state-of-theart nonsmooth methods, the derived algorithms can serve as an alternative to the basic SGD especially in coping with machine learning problems, where an individual output is needed to guarantee the regularization structure while keeping an optimal rate of convergence. Typically, our method is applicable as an efficient tool for solving large-scale l1-regularized hinge-loss learning problems. Several comparison experiments demonstrate that our individual output not only achieves an optimal convergence rate but also guarantees better sparsity than the averaged solution.}

Flops no longer serve as a reasonable proxy for all aspects of complexity. Instead, algorithms must now squeeze memory, data transfers, and synchronizations, while extra flops on locally cached data represent only small costs in time and energy. Hierarchically low-rank matrices realize a rarely achieved combination of optimal storage complexity and high-computational intensity for a wide class of formally dense linear operators that arise in applications for which exascale computers are being constructed. They may be regarded as algebraic generalizations of the fast multipole method. Methods based on these hierarchical data structures and their simpler cousins, tile low-rank matrices, are well proportioned for early exascale computer architectures, which are provisioned for high processing power relative to memory capacity and memory bandwidth. They are ushering in a renaissance of computational linear algebra. A challenge is that emerging hardware architecture possesses hierarchies of its own that do not generally align with those of the algorithm. We describe modules of a software toolkit, hierarchical computations on manycore architectures, that illustrate these features and are intended as building blocks of applications, such as matrix-free higher-order methods in optimization and large-scale spatial statistics. Some modules of this open-source project have been adopted in the software libraries of major vendors.},

Compared with the traditional k-means algorithm, the spectral clustering algorithm has stronger adaptability to data and better clustering results. However, the computation of the algorithm is quite expensive. In this paper, an efficient parallel spectral clustering algorithm on multi-core processors in the Julia language is proposed, and we refer to it as juPSC. The Julia language is a high-performance, open-source programming language. The juPSC is composed of three procedures: (1) calculating the affinity matrix, (2) calculating the eigenvectors, and (3) conducting k-means clustering. Procedures (1) and (3) are computed by the efficient parallel algorithm, and the COO format is used to compress the affinity matrix. Two groups of experiments are conducted to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the juPSC. Experimental results indicate that (1) the juPSC achieves speedups of approximately $14 \times \tilde 18 \times$ on a 24-core CPU and that (2) the serial version of the juPSC is faster than the Python version of scikit-learn. Moreover, the structure and functions of the juPSC are designed considering modularity, which is convenient for combination and further optimization with other parallel computing platforms.},

This paper shows that these two algorithms can "collaborate" through a simple exchange mechanism, in which they swap their current positions if LD yields a lower objective function. This idea can be seen as the singular limit of the replica exchange technique from the sampling literature. We show that this new algorithm converges to the global minimum linearly with high probability, assuming the objective function is strongly convex in a neighborhood of the unique global minimum. By replacing gradients with stochastic gradients, and adding a proper threshold to the exchange mechanism, our algorithm can also be used in online settings. We further verify our theoretical results through some numerical experiments, and observe superior performance of the proposed algorithm over running GD or LD alone.},

Although Ma and Needell [1] has recently proposed a method, termed as mSGD, assuming a model for data missing that results in improved convergence, their result is also affected by constant large variance of the stochastic gradient. In this paper we propose a SGD type method termed as cumulative information SGD (CISGD) for solving a linear system with missing data with an additional provision to accumulate a very small number of matrix entries sequentially per iteration, termed as the sequential matrix entry accumulation (SEMEA) mechanism. CISGD uses the data collected by SEMEA mechanism along with the prior model for data missing mechanism of [1] to gradually reduce variance of the stochastic gradient. The convergence of the proposed CISGD is theoretically analyzed and some interesting implications of the result are investigated under a specific SEMEA mechanism. Finally, numerical experiments are performed along with simulations that corroborate the theoretical findings regarding the efficacy of the proposed CISGD method.},

This may be due to stability problems or complicated algorithms. We implement the GMRES polynomial as a preconditioner in the software library Trilinos and demonstrate that it is stable and effective for parallel computing. Trade-offs when selecting a polynomial degree and combining with other preconditioners are analyzed. We also discuss communication-avoiding (CA) properties of the polynomial and relate these to current CA-GMRES methods.},

This framework allows to obtain many known methods as a special case, the list including accelerated gradient method, composite optimization methods, level-set methods, Bregman proximal methods. The idea of the framework is based on constructing an inexact model of the main problem component, i.e. objective function in optimization or operator in variational inequalities. Besides reproducing known results, our framework allows to construct new methods, which we illustrate by constructing a universal conditional gradient method and universal method for variational inequalities with composite structure. These method works for smooth and non-smooth problems with optimal complexity without a priori knowledge of the problem smoothness. As a particular case of our general framework, we introduce relative smoothness for operators and propose an algorithm for VIs with such operator. We also generalize our framework for relatively strongly convex objectives and strongly monotone variational inequalities. This paper is an extended and updated version of [arXiv:1902.00990]. In particular, we add an extension of relative strong convexity for optimization and variational inequalities.},

Through code review and testing, we found a total of 16 bugs, many of which produce serious consequences, including crashing servers, returning incorrect results to clients, and invalidating verification guarantees. These bugs were caused by violations of a wide-range of assumptions on which the verified components relied. Our results revealed that these assumptions referred to a small fraction of the trusted computing base, mostly at the interface of verified and unverified components.

TLA+ is extremely concise yet expressive: The language primitives include Booleans, integers, functions, tuples, records, sequences, and sets thereof, which can be also nested. This is probably why the only model checker for TLA+ (called TLC) relies on explicit enumeration of values and states. \\ In this paper, we present APALACHE -- a first symbolic model checker for TLA+. Like TLC, it assumes that all specification parameters are fixed and all states are finite structures. Unlike TLC, APALACHE translates the underlying transition relation into quantifier-free SMT constraints, which allows us to exploit the power of SMT solvers. Designing this translation is the central challenge that we address in this paper. Our experiments show that APALACHE outperforms TLC on examples with large state spaces.},

Software-directed instruction replication has been a flexible technique to solve SDCs. However, this method requires a trade-off between reliability and overhead. To this end, it is imperative to explore the SDC criticality of the instructions. In this paper, we carry out fine-grained analysis on instruction error behavior of 11 benchmarks, while previous work focused on the error resilience of the entire application. Combining the error resilience of instructions with the dynamic data flow of applications, we find potential protection opportunities for the instructions.},

It has been shown to perform well in exposing faults. In this paper, we investigate whether GPU programming can benefit from mutation testing. In addition to conventional mutation operators, we propose nine GPU-specific mutation operators based on the core syntax differences between CPU and GPU programming. We conduct a preliminary study on six CUDA systems. The results show that mutation testing can effectively evaluate the test quality of GPU programs: conventional mutation operators can guide the engineers to write simple direct tests, while GPU-specific mutation operators can lead to more intricate test cases which are better at revealing GPU-specific weaknesses.}

  abstract    = {Test instability in a floating-point program occurs when the control flow of the program diverges from its ideal execution assuming real arithmetic. This phenomenon is caused by the presence of round-off errors that affect the evaluation of arithmetic expressions occurring in conditional statements. Unstable tests may lead to significant errors in safety-critical applications that depend on numerical computations. Writing programs that take into consideration test instability is a difficult task that requires expertise on finite precision computations and rounding errors. This paper presents a toolchain to automatically generate and verify a provably correct test-stable floating-point program from a functional specification in real arithmetic. The input is a real-valued program written in the Prototype Verification System (PVS) specification language and the output is a transformed floating-point C program annotated with ANSI/ISO C Specification Language (ACSL) contracts. These contracts relate the floating-point program to its functional specification in real arithmetic. The transformed program detects if unstable tests may occur and, in these cases, issues a warning and terminate. An approach that combines the Frama-C analyzer, the PRECiSA round-off error estimator, and PVS is proposed to automatically verify that the generated program code is correct in the sense that, if the program terminates without a warning, it follows the same computational path as its real-valued functional specification.},

These apply in both standard smooth and composite non-smooth settings, and additionally allow convex or inexpensive constraints. An adaptive regularization algorithm is then proposed to find such approximate minimizers. Under suitable Lipschitz continuity assumptions, whenever the feasible set is convex, it is shown that using a model of degree $p$, this algorithm will find a strong approximate q-th-order minimizer in at most ${\cal O}\left(\max_{1\leq j\leq q}\epsilon_j^{-(p+1)/(p-j+1)}\right)$ evaluations of the problem's functions and their derivatives, where $\epsilon_j$ is the $j$-th order accuracy tolerance; this bound applies when either $q=1$ or the problem is not composite with $q \leq 2$. For general non-composite problems, even when the feasible set is nonconvex, the bound becomes ${\cal O}\left(\max_{1\leq j\leq q}\epsilon_j^{-q(p+1)/p}\right)$ evaluations. If the problem is composite, and either $q > 1$ or the feasible set is not convex, the bound is then ${\cal O}\left(\max_{1\leq j\leq q}\epsilon_j^{-(q+1)}\right)$ evaluations. These results not only provide, to our knowledge, the first known bound for (unconstrained or inexpensively-constrained) composite problems for optimality orders exceeding one, but also give the first sharp bounds for high-order strong approximate $q$-th order minimizers of standard (unconstrained and inexpensively constrained) smooth problems, thereby complementing known results for weak minimizers.},

  abstract = {Spectral graph sparsification aims to find ultra-sparse subgraphs whose Laplacian matrix can well approximate the original Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In recent years, spectral sparsification techniques have been extensively studied for accelerating various numerical and graph-related applications. Prior nearly-linear-time spectral sparsification methods first extract low-stretch spanning tree from the original graph to form the backbone of the sparsifier, and then recover small portions of spectrally-critical off-tree edges to the spanning tree to significantly improve the approximation quality. However, it is not clear how many off-tree edges should be recovered for achieving a desired spectral similarity level within the sparsifier. Motivated by recent graph signal processing techniques, this paper proposes a similarity-aware spectral graph sparsification framework that leverages efficient spectral off-tree edge embedding and filtering schemes to construct spectral sparsifiers with guaranteed spectral similarity (relative condition number) level. An iterative graph densification scheme is also introduced to facilitate efficient and effective filtering of off-tree edges for highly ill-conditioned problems. The proposed method has been validated using various kinds of graphs obtained from public domain sparse matrix collections relevant to VLSI CAD, finite element analysis, as well as social and data networks frequently studied in many machine learning and data mining applications. For instance, a sparse SDD matrix with 40 million unknowns and 180 million nonzeros can be solved (1E-3 accuracy level) within two minutes using a single CPU core and about 6GB memory.},

The interior point methods become computationally intractable, mainly due to the solution of large linear systems. This document addresses the computational bottlenecks of the interior point method during the solution of the security constrained optimal power flow problems by applying reduced space quasi-Newton IPM, which could utilize high-performance computers due to the inherent parallelism in the adjoint method. Reduced space IPM approach and the adjoint method is a novel approach when it comes to solving the (security constrained) optimal power flow problems. These were previously used in the PDE-constrained optimization. The presented methodology is suitable for high-performance architectures due to inherent parallelism in the adjoint method during the gradient evaluation, since the individual contingency scenarios are modeled by independent set of the constraints. Preliminary evaluation of the performance and convergence is performed to study the reduced space approach.},

  abstract = {Automated performance modeling and performance prediction of parallel programs are highly valuable in many use cases, such as in guiding task management and job scheduling, offering insights of application behaviors, and assisting resource requirement estimation. The performance of parallel programs is affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to hardware, applications, algorithms, and input parameters, thus an accurate performance prediction is often a challenging task. In this study, we focus on automatically predicting the execution time of parallel programs with different inputs, at different scale, and without domain knowledge. We model the correlation between the execution time and domain-independent runtime features. These features include values of variables, counters of branches, loops, and MPI communications. After collecting data from executions with different inputs, a random forest machine learning approach is used to build an empirical performance model, which can predict the execution time of the program given an input. An instance-transfer learning method is used to reuse an existing model and improve the prediction on a new platform that lacks historical execution data. Our experiments and analyses of three parallel applications on three different systems confirm that our method performs well, with less than $20\%$ prediction error on average.},

  abstract   = {The standard iterative refinement procedure for improving an approximate solution to the least squares problem $\text{min}_x ||b - Ax||_2$, where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ with $m \ge n$ has full rank, is based on solving the $(m + n) \times (m + n)$ augmented system with the aid of a QR factorization. In order to exploit multiprecision arithmetic, iterative refinement can be formulated to use three precisions, but the resulting algorithm converges only for a limited range of problems. We build an iterative refinement algorithm called GMRES-LSIR, analogous to the GMRES-IR algorithm developed for linear systems [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 40 (2019), pp. A817-A847], that solves the augmented system using GMRES preconditioned by a matrix based on the computed QR factors. We explore two left preconditioners; the first has full off-diagonal blocks and the second is block diagonal and can be applied in either left-sided or split form. We prove that for a wide range of problems the first preconditioner yields backward and forward errors for the augmented system of order the working precision under suitable assumptions on the precisions and the problem conditioning. Our proof does not extend to the block diagonal preconditioner, but our numerical experiments show that with this preconditioner the algorithm performs about as well in practice.}

  institution = {University of California Los Angeles},
  date        = {2020},
  abstract    = {This dissertation studies the performance and linear convergence properties of primal-dual methods for the solution of decentralized multi-agent optimization problems. Decentralized multi-agent optimization is a powerful paradigm that finds applications in diverse fields in learning and engineering design. In these setups, a network of agents is connected through some topology and agents are allowed to share information only locally. Their overall goal is to seek the minimizer of a global optimization problem through localized interactions. In decentralized consensus problems, the agents are coupled through a common consensus variable that they need to agree upon. While in decentralized resource allocation problems, the agents are coupled through global affine constraints.\\ Various decentralized consensus optimization algorithms already exist in the literature. Some methods are derived from a primal-dual perspective, while other methods are derived as gradient tracking mechanisms meant to track the average of local gradients. Among the gradient tracking methods are the adapt-then-combine implementations motivated by diffusion strategies, which have been observed to perform better than other implementations. In this dissertation, we develop a novel adapt-then-combine primal-dual algorithmic framework that captures most state-of-the-art gradient based methods as special cases including all the variations of the gradient-tracking methods. We also develop a concise and novel analysis technique that establishes the linear convergence of this general framework under stronglyii convex objectives. Due to our unified framework, the analysis reveals important characteristics for these methods such as their convergence rates and step-size stability ranges. Moreover, the analysis reveals how the augmented Lagrangian penalty term, which is utilized in most of these methods, affects the performance of decentralized algorithms.\\ Another important question that we answer is whether decentralized proximal gradient methods can achieve global linear convergence for non-smooth composite optimization. For centralized algorithms, linear convergence has been established in the presence of a nonsmooth composite term. In this dissertation, we close the gap between centralized and decentralized proximal gradient algorithms and show that decentralized proximal algorithms can also achieve linear convergence in the presence of a non-smooth term. Furthermore, we show that when each agent possesses a different local non-smooth term then global linear convergence cannot be established in the worst case.\\ Most works that study decentralized optimization problems assume that all agents are involved in computing all variables. However, in many applications the coupling across agents is sparse in the sense that only a few agents are involved in computing certain variables. We show how to design decentralized algorithms in sparsely coupled consensus and resource allocation problems. More importantly, we establish analytically the importance of exploiting the sparsity structure in coupled large-scale networks.}

We show how an SMT formula can be encoded as a program containing a location that is reachable if and only if the program's input corresponds to a satisfying assignment to the formula. A coverage-guided fuzzer can then be used to search for an input that reaches the location, yielding a satisfying assignment. We have implemented this idea in a tool, Just Fuzz-it Solver (JFS), and we present a large experimental evaluation showing that JFS is both competitive with and complementary to state-of-the-art SMT solvers with respect to solving floating-point constraints, and that the coverage-guided approach of JFS provides significant benefit over naive fuzzing in the floating-point domain. Applied in a portfolio manner, the JFS approach thus has the potential to complement traditional SMT solvers for program analysis tasks that involve reasoning about floating-point constraints.}

Further, we investigate the situation when the functions in the sum have Lipschitz derivatives of a different order.

A matrix splitting of the Schur complement is proposed to expand the power series. The number of terms used in the power series expansion can control the approximation accuracy of the preconditioner to the inverse of the Schur complement. To construct the preconditioner, graph partitioning is invoked to reorder the original coefficient matrix, leading to a special block two-by-two matrix whose two off-diagonal submatrices are block diagonal. Variables corresponding to interface variables are obtained by solving a linear system with the coeffcient matrix being the Schur complement. For the variables related to the interior variables, one only needs to solve a block diagonal linear system. This can be performed efficiently in parallel.

For greedy quasi-Newton methods, we establish an explicit non-asymptotic bound on their rate of local superlinear convergence, which contains a contraction factor, depending on the square of the iteration counter.

Some classical methods for matrix eigenvalue problems are discussed. Several PDE eigenvalue problems are covered. The chapter is concluded with a summary of the contributions. In Chapter 2, a novel recursive contour integral method (RIM) for matrix eigenvalue problem is proposed. This method can effectively find all eigenvalues in a region on the complex plane with no a priori spectrum information. Regions that contain eigenvalues are subdivided and tested recursively until the size of region reaches specified precision. The method is robust, which is demonstrated using various examples. In Chapter 3, we propose an improved version of RIM for non-Hermitian eigenvalue problems, called SIM-M. By incorporating Cayley transformation and Arnoldi's method, the main computation cost of solving linear systems is reduced significantly. The numerical experiments demonstrate that RIM-M gains significant speed-up over RIM.\\ In Chapter 4, we propose a multilevel spectral indicator method (SIM-M) to address the memory requirement for large sparse matrices. We modify the indicator of RIM-M such that it requires much less memory. Matrices from University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection are tested, suggesting that a parallel version of SIM-M has the potential to be efficient.\\ In Chapter 5, we develop a novel method to solve the elliptic PDE eigenvalue problem. We construct a multi-wavelet basis with Riesz stability in H1 0 ($\Omega$). By incorporating multi-grid discretization scheme and sparse grids, the method retains the optimal convergence rate for the smallest eigenvalue with much less computational cost.}

Moreover, our approach relies on generating liftand-project cuts using simple 0-1 disjunctions, where cuts are generated at all fractional extreme point solutions of the current relaxation.

More generally, in contractions of symmetric tensors, the symmetries are not preserved in the usual algebraic form of contraction algorithms. We introduce an algorithm that reduces the bilinear complexity (number of computed elementwise products) for most types of symmetric tensor contractions. In particular, it lowers the bilinear complexity of symmetrized contractions of symmetric tensors of order $s+v$ and $v+t$ by a factor of $\frac{(s+t+v)!}{s!t!v!}$ to leading order. The algorithm computes a symmetric tensor of bilinear products, then subtracts unwanted parts of its partial sums. Special cases of this algorithm provide improvements to the bilinear complexity of the multiplication of a symmetric matrix and a vector, the symmetrized vector outer product, and the symmetrized product of symmetric matrices. While the algorithm requires more additions for each elementwise product, the total number of operations is in some cases less than classical algorithms, for tensors of any size. We provide a round-off error analysis of the algorithm and demonstrate that the error is not too large in practice. Finally, we provide an optimized implementation for one variant of the symmetry-preserving algorithm, which achieves speedups of up to 4.58$\times$ for a particular tensor contraction, relative to a classical approach that casts the problem as a matrix-matrix multiplication.},

  abstract  = {In spatial branch-and-bound algorithms, optimality-based domain reduction is normally performed after solving a node and relies on duality information to reduce ranges of variables. In this work, we propose novel optimality conditions for NLP and MINLP problems and apply them for domain reduction prior to solving a node in branch-and-bound. The conditions apply to nonconvex inequality-constrained problems for which we exploit monotonicity properties of objectives and constraints. We develop three separate reduction algorithms for unconstrained, one-constraint, and multi-constraint problems. We use the optimality conditions to reduce ranges of variables through forward and backward bound propagation of gradients respective to each decision variable. We describe an efficient implementation of these techniques in the branch-and-bound solver BARON. The implementation dynamically recognizes and ignores inactive constraints at each node of the search tree. Our computations demonstrate that the proposed techniques often reduce the solution time and total number of nodes for continuous problems; they are less effective for mixed-integer programs.},

Assuming that $f$ can be written as a sum of forms $\sum_{l=1}^p f_l$, where each $f_l$ depends on a subset of the initial variables, and assuming that these subsets satisfy the so-called running intersection property, we provide a sparse version of Reznick's Positivstellensatz. Namely, there exists $k \in \mathbf{N}$ such that $f=\sum_{l = 1}^p {{\sigma_l}/{H_l^{k}}}$, where $\sigma_l$ is a sum of squares of polynomials, $H_l$ is a uniform polynomial denominator, and both polynomials $\sigma_l,H_l$ involve the same variables as $f_l$, for each $l=1,\dots,p$. In other words, the sparsity pattern of $f$ is also reflected in this sparse version of Reznick's certificate of positivity. We next use this result to also obtain positivity certificates for (i) polynomials nonnegative on the whole space and (ii) polynomials nonnegative on a (possibly non-compact) basic semialgebraic set, assuming that the input data satisfy the running intersection property. Both are sparse versions of a positivity certificate due to Putinar and Vasilescu.},

At each iteration of our method, we solve a nontrivial auxiliary problem by a linearly convergent scheme based on the relative non-degeneracy condition [3, 10].

This opens a possibility for the latter methods to overpass traditional limits of the Complexity Theory. As an example, we obtain a new second-order method with the convergence rate $O(k^{-4})$ , where $k$ is the iteration counter.

We then propose to find the solution using a Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel fixed-point iteration method, as well as hybrid methods of both. Crucially, Jacobi updates operate independently on each equation and can be executed in parallel. Our method is guaranteed to give exactly the same values as the original feedforward computation with a reduced (or equal) number of parallel iterations. Experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating 1) the evaluation of DenseNets on ImageNet and 2) autoregressive sampling of MADE and PixelCNN.

We improve over these results by drawing a new link between the sparsity and the smoothness of the DSBM: the more regular the DSBM is, the more sparse it can be, while still guaranteeing consistent recovery. In particular, a mild condition on the smoothness allows to treat the sparse case with bounded degree. We also extend these guarantees to the normalized Laplacian, and as a by-product of our analysis, we obtain to our knowledge the best spectral concentration bound available for the normalized Laplacian of matrices with independent Bernoulli entries.},

This method is particularly expensive for third-generation sequences due to the high computational cost of analyzing sequences of length between 1Kb and 1Mb. Given the quadratic overhead of exact pairwise algorithms for long alignments, the community primarily relies on approximate algorithms that search only for high-quality alignments and stop early when one is not found. In this work, we present the first GPU optimization of the popular X-drop alignment algorithm, that we named LOGAN. Results show that our high-performance multi-GPU implementation achieves up to 181.6 GCUPS and speed-ups up to 6.6$\times$ and 30.7$\times$ using 1 and 6 NVIDIA Tesla V100, respectively, over the state-of-the-art software running on two IBM Power9 processors using 168 CPU threads, with equivalent accuracy. We also demonstrate a 2.3$\times$ LOGAN speed-up versus ksw2, a state-of-art vectorized algorithm for sequence alignment implemented in minimap2, a long-read mapping software. To highlight the impact of our work on a real-world application, we couple LOGAN with a many-to-many long-read alignment software called BELLA, and demonstrate that our implementation improves the overall BELLA runtime by up to 10.6$\times$. Finally, we adapt the Roofline model for LOGAN and demonstrate that our implementation is near-optimal on the NVIDIA Tesla V100s.},

The multi-projection type methods have improved convergence behavior, as the number of subdomains increases, due to the corresponding augmentation of the semi-aggregated local linear systems with more coarse components, while the number of fine components is reduced. Moreover, limited amount of communications among the workstations is required by the proposed method.

An effective parallel solver should meet the required specifications, concerning both convergence behavior and scalability. Herewith, a class of two-stage algebraic domain decomposition preconditioning schemes based on the upper Schur complement method is proposed, in order to exploit appropriately distributed memory systems with multicore processors. The design of the method has been focused on homogeneous hybrid parallel systems, i.e., distributed and shared memory systems. However, the proposed method can also be applied to heterogeneous systems, such as cloud infrastructures, or hybrid parallel systems with accelerators, by modifying the workload distribution algorithm and taking into account the different network latencies and bandwidths. The first stage of the proposed schemes is related to the assignment of the subdomains among the workstations of the distributed system, whereas the second stage concerns the further redistribution of the subdomains to each core of a processor. The proposed method utilizes multiprojection techniques, based on semi-aggregated subdomains, leading to improved convergence behavior as the number of subdomains increases. Moreover, a subspace compression technique is used, in order to improve the performance of the preprocessing phase and reduce the memory requirements of the proposed scheme. The preconditioning schemes were combined with a parallel Krylov subspace method, i.e., the parallel preconditioned GMRES(m) method. The convergence behavior, the performance and the scalability of the proposed preconditioning schemes are examined and compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, by conducting several numerical experiments on supercomputing infrastructures.},

Floyd-Warshall is an attractive choice for Apsp on high-performing systems due to its structural similarity to solving dense linear systems and matrix multiplication. However, if sparsity of the input graph is not properly exploited, Floyd-Warshall will perform unnecessary asymptotic work and thus may not be a suitable choice for many input graphs. To overcome this limitation, the key idea in our approach is to use the known algebraic relationship between Floyd-Warshall and Gaussian elimination, and import several algorithmic techniques from sparse Cholesky factorization, namely, fill-in reducing ordering, symbolic analysis, supernodal traversal, and elimination tree parallelism. When combined, these techniques reduce computation, improve locality and enhance parallelism. We implement these ideas in an efficient shared memory parallel prototype that is orders of magnitude faster than an efficient multi-threaded baseline Floyd-Warshall that does not exploit sparsity. Our experiments suggest that the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can compete with Dijkstra's algorithm (the algorithmic core of Johnson's algorithm) for several classes sparse graphs.}

  abstract    = {Generalized Sparse Matri$\times$-Matri$\times$ Multiplication (SpGEMM) is a ubiquitous task in various engineering and scientific applications. However, inner product based SpGENN introduces redundant input fetches for mismatched nonzero operands, while outer product based approach suffers from poor output locality due to numerous partial product matrices. Inefficiency in the reuse of either inputs or outputs data leads to e$\times$tensive and e$\times$pensive DRAM access. To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient sparse matri$\times$ multiplication accelerator architecture, SpArch, which jointly optimizes the data locality for both input and output matrices. We first design a highly parallelized streaming-based merger to pipeline the multiply and merge stage of partial matrices so that partial matrices are merged on chip immediately after produced. We then propose a condensed matri$\times$ representation that reduces the number of partial matrices by three orders of magnitude and thus reduces DRAM access by 5.4$\times$. We further develop a Huffman tree scheduler to improve the scalability of the merger for larger sparse matrices, which reduces the DRAM access by another 1.8$\times$. We also resolve the increased input matri$\times$ read induced by the new representation using a row prefetcher with near-optimal buffer replacement policy, further reducing the DRAM access by 1.5$\times$. Evaluated on 20 benchmarks, SpArch reduces the total DRAM access by 2.8$\times$ over previous state-of-the-art. On average, SpArch achieves 4$\times$, 19$\times$, 18$\times$, 17$\times$, 1285$\times$ speedup and 6$\times$, 164$\times$, 435$\times$, 307$\times$, 62$\times$ energy savings over OuterSPACE, MKL, cuSPARSE, CUSP, and ARM Armadillo, respectively.},

  abstract  = {parse general matrix-matrix multiplication on GPUs is challenging due to the varying sparsity patterns of sparse matrices. Existing solutions achieve good performance for certain types of matrices, but fail to accelerate all kinds of matrices in the same manner. Our approach combines multiple strategies with dynamic parameter selection to dynamically choose and tune the best fitting algorithm for each row of the matrix. This choice is supported by a lightweight, multi-level matrix analysis, which carefully balances analysis cost and expected performance gains. Our evaluation on thousands of matrices with various characteristics shows that we outperform all currently available solutions in 79\% over all matrices with >15k products and that we achieve the second best performance in 15\%. For these matrices, our solution is on average 83\% faster than the second best approach and up to 25$\times$ faster than other state-of-the-art GPU implementations. Using our approach, applications can expect great performance independent of the matrices they work on.}

As a result, we get convergence rate $O(N^{-5})$ up to a logarithmic factor. This convergence rate is near-optimal and the best known up to this moment. Further, we investigate the situation when there is a sum of two functions and improve the sliding framework from Kamzolov et al. (arXiv:2002.01004) for the second-order methods.},

Essentially, it requires generating suitable random paths which evolve through the indices of the matrix according to the probability law of a continuous-time Markov chain governed by the associated Laplacian matrix. The convergence of the proposed multilevel method has been discussed, and several numerical examples were run to test the performance of the algorithm. These examples concern the computation of some metrics of interest in the analysis of complex networks, and the numerical solution of a boundary-value problem for an elliptic partial differential equation.

  abstract    = {Multinomial Logistic Regression is a well-studied tool for classification and has been widely used in fields like image processing, computer vision and, bioinformatics, to name a few. Under a supervised classification scenario, a Multinomial Logistic Regression model learns a weight vector to differentiate between any two classes by optimizing over the likelihood objective. With the advent of big data, the inundation of data has resulted in large dimensional weight vector and has also given rise to a huge number of classes, which makes the classical methods applicable for model estimation not computationally viable. To handle this issue, we here propose a parallel iterative algorithm: Parallel Iterative Algorithm for MultiNomial LOgistic Regression (PIANO) which is based on the Majorization Minimization procedure, and can parallely update each element of the weight vectors. Further, we also show that PIANO can be easily extended to solve the Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression problem - an extensively studied problem because of its attractive feature selection property. In particular, we work out the extension of PIANO to solve the Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression problem with l1 and l0 regularizations. We also prove that PIANO converges to a stationary point of the Multinomial and the Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression problems. Simulations were conducted to compare PIANO with the existing methods, and it was found that the proposed algorithm performs better than the existing methods in terms of speed of convergence.},

Our method can be seen both as a {\em stochastic} extension of the cubically-regularized Newton method of Nesterov and Polyak (2006), and a {\em second-order} enhancement of stochastic subspace descent of Kozak et al. (2019). We prove that as we vary the minibatch size, the global convergence rate of SSCN interpolates between the rate of stochastic coordinate descent (CD) and the rate of cubic regularized Newton, thus giving new insights into the connection between first and second-order methods. Remarkably, the local convergence rate of SSCN matches the rate of stochastic subspace descent applied to the problem of minimizing the quadratic function $\frac12 (x-x^*)^\top \nabla^2f(x^*)(x-x^*)$, where $x^*$ is the minimizer of $f$, and hence depends on the properties of $f$ at the optimum only. Our numerical experiments show that SSCN outperforms non-accelerated first-order CD algorithms while being competitive to their accelerated variants.},

The existing parallel algorithms in HipMCL are not scalable to Exascale architectures, both due to their communication costs dominating the runtime at large concurrencies and also due to their inability to take advantage of accelerators that are increasingly popular. In this work, we systematically remove scalability and performance bottlenecks of HipMCL. We enable GPUs by performing the expensive expansion phase of the MCL algorithm on GPU. We propose a CPU-GPU joint distributed SpGEMM algorithm called pipelined Sparse SUMMA and integrate a probabilistic memory requirement estimator that is fast and accurate. We develop a new merging algorithm for the incremental processing of partial results produced by the GPUs, which improves the overlap efficiency and the peak memory usage. We also integrate a recent and faster algorithm for performing SpGEMM on CPUs. We validate our new algorithms and optimizations with extensive evaluations. With the enabling of the GPUs and integration of new algorithms, HipMCL is up to 12.4x faster, being able to cluster a network with 70 million proteins and 68 billion connections just under 15 minutes using 1024 nodes of ORNL's Summit supercomputer.},

In this paper we characterize existing SpGEMM algorithms based on their memory access patterns and develop practical lower and upper bounds for SpGEMM performance. We then develop an SpGEMM algorithm based on outer product matrix multiplication. The newly developed algorithm called PB-SpGEMM saturates memory bandwidth by using the propagation blocking technique and by performing in-cache sorting and merging. For many practical matrices, PB-SpGEMM runs 20\%-50\% faster than the state-of-the-art heap and hash SpGEMM algorithms on modern multicore processors. Most importantly, PB-SpGEMM attains performance predicted by the Roofline model, and its performance remains stable with respect to matrix size and sparsity.},

Although more than sixty year old, it is still a serious candidate for extreme-scale computation on large computing platforms. On the technological side, the continuous shrinking of transistor geometry and the increasing complexity of these devices affect dramatically their sensitivity to natural radiation, and thus diminish their reliability. One of the most common effects produced by natural radiation is the single event upset which consists in a bit-flip in a memory cell producing unexpected results at application level. Consequently, the future computing facilities at extreme scale might be more prone to errors of any kind including bit-flip during calculation. These numerical and technological observations are the main motivations for this work, where we first investigate through extensive numerical experiments the sensitivity of CG to bit-flips in its main computationally intensive kernels, namely the matrix-vector product and the preconditioner application. We further propose numerical criteria to detect the occurrence of such soft errors; we assess their robustness through extensive numerical experiments.},

As this can lead to memory overflow, we propose a new approach to address mesh partitioning by including ghost cells in the memory usage and by considering memory capacity as a strong constraint to abide. We model the problem using a bipartite graph and present a new greedy algorithm that aims at producing a partition according to the memory capacity. This algorithm focuses on memory consumption, and we use it in a multi-level approach to improving the quality of the returned solutions during the refinement phase. The experimental results obtained from our benchmarks show that our approach can yield solutions respecting memory constraints for instances where traditional partitioning tools fail.},

  abstract = {As high-performance computing (HPC) systems have scaled up, resilience has become a great challenge. To guarantee resilience, various kinds of hardware and software techniques have been proposed. However, among popular software fault-tolerant techniques, both the checkpoint-restart approach and the replication technique face challenges of scalability in the era of peta- and exa-scale systems due to their numerous processes. In this situation, algorithm-based approaches, or algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) mechanisms, have become attractive because they are efficient and lightweight. Although the ABFT technique is algorithm-dependent, it is possible to implement it at a low level (e.g., in libraries for basic numerical algorithms) and make it application-independent. However, previous ABFT approaches have mainly aimed at achieving fault tolerance in integrated circuits (ICs) or at the architecture level and are therefore not suitable for HPC systems; e.g., they use checksums of rows and columns of matrices rather than checksums of blocks to detect errors. Furthermore, they cannot deal with errors caused by node failure, which are common in current HPC systems. To solve these problems, this paper proposes FT-PBLAS, a PBLAS-based library for fault-tolerant parallel linear algebra computations that can be regarded as a fault-tolerant version of the parallel basic linear algebra subprograms (PBLAS), because it provides a series of fault-tolerant versions of interfaces in PBLAS. To support the underlying error detection and recovery mechanisms in the library, we propose a block-checksum approach for non-fatal errors and a scheme for addressing node failure, respectively. We evaluate two fault-tolerant mechanisms and FT-PBLAS on HPC systems, and the experimental results demonstrate the performance of our library.},

  abstract    = {Reducing communication - either between levels of a memory hierarchy or between processors over a network - is a key component of performance optimization (in both time and energy) for many problems, including dense linear algebra, particle interactions, and machine learning. For these problems, which can be represented as nested-loop computations, previous tiling based approaches have been used to find both lower bounds on the communication required to execute them and optimal rearrangements, or blockings, to attain such lower bounds. However, such general approaches have typically assumed the problem sizes are large, an assumption that is often not met in practice. For instance, the classical $(\text{num arithmetic operations})/(\text{cache size})^{1/2}$ lower bound for matrix multiplication is not tight for matrix-vector multiplications, which must read in at least $O(\text{num arithmetic operations})$ words of memory; similar issues occur for almost all convolutions in machine learning applications, which use extremely small filter sizes (and therefore, loop bounds). In this paper, we provide an efficient way to both find and obtain, via an appropriate, efficiently constructible blocking, communication lower bounds and matching tilings which attain these lower bounds for nested loop programs with arbitrary loop bounds that operate on multidimensional arrays in the projective case, where the array indices are subsets of the loop indices. Our approach works on all such problems, regardless of dimensionality, size, memory access patterns, or number of arrays, and directly applies to (among other examples) matrix multiplication and similar dense linear algebra operations, tensor contractions, n-body pairwise interactions, pointwise convolutions, and fully connected layers.},

  abstract  = {High performance computing applications, runtimes, and platforms are becoming more configurable to enable applications to obtain better performance. As a result, users are increasingly presented with a multitude of options to configure application-specific as well as platform-level parameters. The combined effect of different parameter choices on application performance is difficult to predict, and an exhaustive evaluation of this combinatorial parameter space is practically infeasible. One approach to parameter selection is a user-guided exploration of a part of the space. However, such an ad hoc exploration of the parameter space can result in suboptimal choices. Therefore, an automatic approach that can efficiently explore the parameter space is needed. In this paper, we propose HiPerBOt, a Bayesian optimization based configuration selection framework to identify application and platform-level parameters that result in high performing configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiPerBOt in tuning parameters that include compiler flags, runtime settings, and application-level options for several parallel codes, including, Kripke, Hypre, LULESH, and OpenAtom.}

As compared with [21], we replace the auxiliary line search by a convex segment search. This allows us to bound its complexity of by a logarithm of the desired accuracy. Each step in this search needs an approximate computation of the proximal-point operator. Under assumption on boundedness of $(p+1)$st derivative of the objective function, this can be done by one step of the pth-order augmented tensor method. In this way, for $p = 2$, we get a new second-order method with the rate of convergence $O(^{k-7/2})$ and logarithmic complexity of the auxiliary search at each iteration. Another possibility is to compute the proximal-point operator by lower-order minimization methods. As an example, for $p = 3$, we consider the upper-level process convergent as $O^{(k-5)}$. Assuming the boundedness of fourth derivative, an appropriate approximation of the proximal-point operator can be computed by a second-order method in logarithmic number of iterations. This combination gives a second-order scheme with much better complexity than the existing theoretical limits.}

Our variable-precision strategy, using a customized precision format based on mantissa segmentation (CPMS), abandons the IEEE 754 single- and double-precision number representation formats employed in the standard implementation of PageRank, and instead handles the data in memory using a customized floating-point format. The customized format enables fast data access in different accuracy, prevents overflow/underflow by preserving the IEEE 754 double-precision exponent, and efficiently avoids data duplication, since all bits of the original IEEE 754 double-precision mantissa are preserved in memory, but re-organized for efficient reduced precision access. With this approach, the truncated values (omitting significand bits), as well as the original IEEE double-precision values, can be retrieved without duplicating the data in different formats.\\ Our numerical experiments on an NVIDIA V100 GPU (Volta architecture) and a server equipped with two Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPUs (48 cores in total) expose that, compared with a standard IEEE double-precision implementation, the CPMS-based PageRank completes about 10\% faster if high-accuracy output is needed, and about 30\% faster if reduced output accuracy is acceptable.},

The Hermitian eigenvalue problem on the other hand seems to evade such treatment at first glance due to its inherent iterative nature. In this paper we prove this assertion wrong by showing the equivalence of the Hermitian eigenvalue problem with a symbolic edge elimination procedure. A symbolic calculation based on the incidence graph of the matrix can be used in analogy to the symbolic phase of Gaussian elimination to develop heuristics which reduce memory footprint and computations. Yet, we also show that the question of an optimal elimination strategy remains NP-hard, in analogy to the linear systems case.},

The contributions of ENTMOOT include: (i) explicitly introducing a reliable uncertainty measure that is compatible with tree models, (ii) solving the larger optimization problems that incorporate these uncertainty aware tree models, (iii) proving that the solutions are globally optimal, i.e. no better solution exists.

  abstract  = {The factorization of sparse symmetric indefinite systems is particularly challenging since pivoting is required to maintain stability of the factorization. Pivoting techniques generally offer limited parallelism and are associated with significant data movement hindering the scalability of these methods. Variants of the threshold partial pivoting (TPP) algorithm, for example, have often been used because of its numerical robustness but standard implementations exhibit poor parallel performance. On the other hand, some methods trade stability for performance on parallel architectures such as the supernode Bunch--Kaufman used in the PARDISO solver. In this case, however, the factors obtained might not be used to accurately compute the solution of the system. For this reason we have designed a task-based $LDL^{T}$ factorization algorithm based on a new pivoting strategy called a posteriori threshold pivoting (APTP) that is much more suitable for modern multicore architectures and has the same numerical robustness as the TPP strategy. We implemented our algorithm in a new version of the SPRAL sparse symmetric indefinite direct solver, which initially supported GPU-only factorization. We have used OpenMP 4 task features to implement a multifrontal algorithm with dense factorizations using the novel APTP, and we show that it performs favorably compared to the state-of-the-art solvers HSL\_MA86, HSL\_MA97 and PARDISO both in terms of performance on a multicore machine and in terms of numerical robustness. Finally we show that this new solver is able to make use of GPU devices for accelerating the factorization on heterogeneous architectures.},

Most methodologies used in graph signal sampling are designed to parallel those used in sampling for standard signals, however, sampling theory for graph signals significantly differs from that for Shannon--Nyquist and shift invariant signals. This is due in part to the fact that the definitions of several important properties, such as shift invariance and bandlimitedness, are different in GSP systems.

Synchronizing across all these compute resources in a single node or even across multiple nodes is prohibitively expensive. Hence it is necessary to develop and study asynchronous algorithms that circumvent this issue of bulk-synchronous computing for massive parallelism. In this study, we examine the asynchronous version of the abstract Restricted Additive Schwarz method as a solver where we do not explicitly synchronize, but allow for communication of the data between the sub-domains to be completely asynchronous thereby removing the bulk synchronous nature of the algorithm. We accomplish this by using the onesided RMA functions of the MPI standard. We study the benefits of using such an asynchronous solver over its synchronous counterpart on both multi-core architectures and on multiple GPUs. We also study the communication patterns and local solvers and their effect on the global solver. Finally, we show that this concept can render attractive runtime benefits over the synchronous counterparts.},

  abstract  = {Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is one of the important subroutines in numerical linear algebras widely used in lots of large-scale applications. Accelerating SpMV on multicore and manycore architectures based on Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format via row-wise parallelization is one of the most popular directions. However, there are three main challenges in optimizing parallel CSR-based SpMV: (a) limited local memory of each computing unit can be overwhelmed by assignments to long rows of large-scale sparse matrices; (b) irregular accesses to the input vector result in expensive memory access latency; (c) sparse data structure leads to low bandwidth usage. This paper proposes a two-phase large-scale SpMV, called tpSpMV, based on the memory structure and computing architecture of multicore and manycore architectures to alleviate the three main difficulties. First, we propose the two-phase parallel execution technique for tpSpMV that performs parallel CSR-based SpMV into two separate phases to overcome the computational scale limitation. Second, we respectively propose the adaptive partitioning methods and parallelization designs using the local memory caching technique for the two phases to exploit the architectural advantages of the high-performance computing platforms and alleviate the problem of high memory access latency. Third, we design several optimizations, such as data reduction, aligned memory accessing, and pipeline technique, to improve bandwidth usage and optimize tpSpMV's performance. Experimental results on SW26010 CPUs of the Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer prove that tpSpMV achieves up to 28.61 speedups and yields the performance improvement of 13.16\% over the state-of-the-art work on average.},

This parallel algorithm assumes the coefficient matrix in a block-diagonal column-overlapped (BDCO) form, which is a variant of the block-diagonal form where the successive diagonal blocks may overlap along their columns. The total overlap size of the BDCO form is an important metric in the performance of the subject parallel algorithm since it determines the size of the reduced system, solution of which is a bottleneck operation in the parallel algorithm. In this work, we propose a hypergraph partitioning model for reordering sparse matrices into BDCO form with the objective of minimizing the total overlap size and the constraint of maintaining balance on the number of nonzeros of the diagonal blocks. Our model makes use of existing partitioning tools that support fixed vertices in the recursive bipartitioning paradigm. Experimental results validate the use of our model as it achieves small overlap size and balanced diagonal blocks.},

However, AIWC metrics are not always easily interpreted and do not reflect some important memory access patterns affecting efficiency across architectures. We propose a new metric of parallel spatial locality -- the closeness of memory accesses simultaneously issued by OpenCL work-items (threads). We implement the parallel spatial locality metric in the AIWC framework, and analyse gathered results on matrix multiply and the Extended OpenDwarfs OpenCL benchmarks. The differences in the observed parallel spatial locality metric across implementations of matrix multiply reflect the optimizations performed. The new metric can be used to distinguish between the OpenDwarfs benchmarks based on the memory access patterns affecting their performance on various architectures. The improvements suggested to AIWC will help HPC developers better understand memory access patterns of complex codes and guide optimization of codes for arbitrary hardware targets.},

Floating-point representation is by definition a finite approximation of real numbers, and thus it can lead to inaccuracy and reproducibility issues. To overcome these issues, existing work has proposed high-precision floating-point libraries to be used in scientific simulations, but they come at the cost of significant additional execution time. In this work we analyze performance and accuracy effects from tuning down groups of variables and operations guided by compile-time considerations. The goal of our tuning approach is to convert existing floating-point programs to mixed precision while balancing accuracy and performance. To this end, the tuner starts by maximizing accuracy through the use of a high-precision library and then achieves performance gains under a given error bound by incrementally tuning down groups of variables and operations from higher to lower precision (e.g., double precision). The approach provides input-data independence in its results by defining tuning strategies based on loop structures and the investigation of floating-point computation patterns. In addition, it has a smaller search space than exhaustive or bitonic search algorithms, leading to a significant reduction in tuning time, especially on larger, long-running applications. We tested our tuning on a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) application.},

  abstract    = {Multi-way data analysis has become an essential tool for capturing underlying structures in higher-order datasets stored in tensor $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R} ^{I_1 \times \dots \times I_N}$. CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition has been extensively studied and applied to approximate $\mathcal{X}$ by $N$ loading matrices $A^{(1)}, \dots, A^{(N)}$ where $N$ represents the order of the tensor. We propose a new efficient CP decomposition solver named NeCPD for non-convex problem in multi-way online data based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. SGD is very useful in online setting since it allows us to update $\mathcal{X}^{(t+1)}$ in one single step. In terms of global convergence, it is well known that SGD stuck in many saddle points when it deals with non-convex problems. We study the Hessian matrix to identify theses saddle points, and then try to escape them using the perturbation approach which adds little noise to the gradient update step. We further apply Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG) method in SGD algorithm to optimally accelerate the convergence rate and compensate Hessian computational delay time per epoch. Experimental evaluation in the field of structural health monitoring using laboratory-based and real-life structural datasets show that our method provides more accurate results compared with existing online tensor analysis methods.},

We obtain first explicit non-asymptotic rates of superlinear convergence for the standard quasi-Newton methods, which are based on the updating formulas from the convex Broyden class. In particular, for the well-known DFP and BFGS methods, we obtain the rates of the form $(\frac{n L^2}{\mu^2 k})^{k/2}$ and $(\frac{n L}{\mu k})^{k/2}$ respectively, where $k$ is the iteration counter, $n$ is the dimension of the problem, $\mu$ is the strong convexity parameter, and $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient.},

Scientists, who are typically comfortable with numerical analysis tools but are not familiar with the intricacies of Big Data analytics, must now learn to convert their loop-based programs to distributed data-parallel programs. We present a novel framework for translating programs expressed as array-based loops to distributed data parallel programs that is more general and efficient than related work. Although our translations are over sparse arrays, we extend our framework to handle packed arrays, such as tiled matrices, without sacrificing performance. We report on a prototype implementation on top of Spark and evaluate the performance of our system relative to hand-written programs.},

  abstract    = {The increasing complexity of computing systems places a tremendous burden on optimizing compilers, requiring ever more accurate and aggressive optimizations. Machine learning offers significant benefits for constructing optimization heuristics but there remains a gap between what state-of-the-art methods achieve and the performance of an optimal heuristic. Closing this gap requires improvements in two key areas: a representation that accurately captures the semantics of programs, and a model architecture with sufficient expressiveness to reason about this representation. We introduce ProGraML - Program Graphs for Machine Learning - a novel graph-based program representation using a low level, language agnostic, and portable format; and machine learning models capable of performing complex downstream tasks over these graphs. The ProGraML representation is a directed attributed multigraph that captures control, data, and call relations, and summarizes instruction and operand types and ordering. Message Passing Neural Networks propagate information through this structured representation, enabling whole-program or per-vertex classification tasks. ProGraML provides a general-purpose program representation that equips learnable models to perform the types of program analysis that are fundamental to optimization. To this end, we evaluate the performance of our approach first on a suite of traditional compiler analysis tasks: control flow reachability, dominator trees, data dependencies, variable liveness, and common subexpression detection. On a benchmark dataset of 250k LLVM-IR files covering six source programming languages, ProGraML achieves an average 94.0 F1 score, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. We then apply our approach to two high-level tasks - heterogeneous device mapping and program classification - setting new state-of-the-art performance in both.},

In addition, the algorithm is highly parallelizable and suitable for large scale problems. Theoretically, we characterize the sufficient conditions for when $L_*$ can be approximated by a low rank approximation of the observed $M_*$.

A recent very popular approach to recovering a low-rank matrix $X$ is to factorize it as a product of two smaller matrices, i.e., $X=UV^T$, and then optimize over $U$, $V$ instead of $X$. Despite the resulting non-convexity, recent results have shown that the factorized objective functions have benign global geometry---with no spurious local minima and satisfying the so-called strict saddle property---ensuring convergence to a global minimum for many local-search algorithms. However, most of these results actually consider a modified cost function that includes a balancing regularizer. While useful for deriving theory, this balancing regularizer does not appear to be necessary in practice. In this work, we close this theory-practice gap by proving that the original factorized non-convex problem, without the balancing regularizer, also has similar benign global geometry. Moreover, we also extend our theoretical results to the field of distributed optimization.},

Javelin allows for improved parallel factorization on shared-memory many-core systems by packaging the coefficient matrix into a format that allows for high performance sparse matrix-vector multiplication and sparse triangular solves with minimal overheads. The framework achieves these goals by using a collection of traditional permutations, point-to-point thread synchronizations, tasking, and segmented prefix scans in a conventional compressed sparse row (CSR) format. Moreover, this framework stresses the importance of co-designing dependent tasks, such as sparse factorization and triangular solves, on highly-threaded architectures. We compare our method to the past distributed methods for incomplete factorization (Aztec) and current multithreaded packages (WSMP) in order to demonstrate the importance of having highly threaded factorizations on many-core systems. Using these changes, traditional fill-in and drop tolerance methods can be used, while still being able to have observed speedups of up to $\sim 42 \times$ on 68 Intel Knights Landing cores and $\sim 12 \times$  on 14 Intel Haswell cores. Moreover, this work provides insight into how the new data-structure impacts iteration counts, and provides insight into future improvements, such as point to GPUs.},

In this sense, Field–Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have evolved greatly in the last years, entering the HPC hardware ecosystem largely due to their superior energy–efficiency relative to more established accelerators. Up until recently, the design for FPGAs implied the use of low–level Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as VHDL or Verilog. Nowadays, manufacturers are making a large effort to adopt High–Level Synthesis languages like C/C++ or OpenCL, but the gap between their performance and that of HDLs is not yet fully studied. This work focuses on the performance offered by FPGAs to compute the sptrsv using OpenCL. For this purpose, we implement different parallel variants of this kernel and experimentally evaluate several setups, varying among others the work–group size, the number of compute units, the unroll–factor and the vectorization–factor.},

  abstract  = {Subspace clustering has been widely applied to detect meaningful clusters in high-dimensional data spaces. And the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) obtains superior clustering performance by solving a relaxed $\epsilon_0$-minimization problem with  $\epsilon_1$-norm. Although the use of  $\epsilon_1$-norm instead of the  $\epsilon_0$ one can make the object function convex, it causes large errors on large coefficients in some cases. In this paper, we study the sparse subspace clustering algorithm based on a nonconvex modeling formulation. Specifically, we introduce a nonconvex pseudo-norm that makes a better approximation to the  $\epsilon_0$-minimization than the traditional  $\epsilon_1$-minimization framework and consequently finds a better affinity matrix. However, this formulation makes the optimization task challenging due to that the traditional alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) encounters troubles in solving the nonconvex subproblems. In view of this, the reweighted techniques are employed in making these subproblems convex and easily solvable. We provide several guarantees to derive the convergence results, which proves that the nonconvex algorithm is globally convergent to a critical point. Experiments on two real-world problems of motion segmentation and face clustering show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.},

Soft errors may cause Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs), which produces erroneous execution results silently. Due to the massive parallelism of GPGPUs, fully protecting them against soft errors introduces nontrivial overhead. Fortunately, imprecise execution outcomes are inherently tolerable for some HPC programs due to the nature of these applications. Leveraging the feature, selective soft error protection can be applied to reduce energy consumptions.\\ In this work, we first propose a GPGPU-based Soft-Error aware APproximation analysis framework (G-SEAP) to characterize the approximation characteristics of soft errors. Based on G-SEAP, we perform an exhaustive analysis for 17 representative HPC benchmarks and observe 72.7\% of SDCs on average are approximable. We also observe that the dataflow of application, kernel function reliability requirement, instruction-type, and data bit-location are all important factors for program's correctness. Lastly, according to observations, we further design an approximate Error Correction Codes (ECCs) mechanism and an approximate instruction duplication technique to illustrate how G-SEAP provides useful guidance for energy-efficient soft-error elimination in GPGPUs.},

Such matrices are random but have a specified singular value distribution. The cost of forming an $m \times n$ randsvd matrix is $m^3 + n ^3$ flops, which is prohibitively expensive at extreme scale; moreover, the randsvd construction requires a significant amount of communication, making it unsuitable for distributed memory environments. By dropping the requirement that $U$ and $V$ be Haar distributed and that both be random, we derive new algorithms for forming $A$ that have cost linear in the number of matrix elements and require a low amount of communication and synchronization. We specialize these algorithms to generating matrices with specified 2-norm condition number. Numerical experiments show that the algorithms have excellent efficiency and scalability.}

Resolving it requires innovations in the development of data formats, computational techniques, and implementations that strike a balance between thread divergence, which is inherent for Irregular Matrices, and padding, which alleviates the performance-detrimental thread divergence but introduces artificial overheads. To this end, in this article, we address the challenge of designing high performance sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) kernels designed for Nvidia Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We present a compressed sparse row (CSR) format suitable for unbalanced matrices. We also provide a load-balancing kernel for the coordinate (COO) matrix format and extend it to a hybrid algorithm that stores part of the matrix in SIMD-friendly Ellpack format (ELL) format. The ratio between the ELL- and the COO-part is determined using a theoretical analysis of the nonzeros-per-row distribution. For the over 2,800 test matrices available in the Suite Sparse matrix collection, we compare the performance against SpMV kernels provided by NVIDIA's cuSPARSE library and a heavily-tuned sliced ELL (SELL-P) kernel that prevents unnecessary padding by considering the irregular matrices as a combination of matrix blocks stored in ELL format.},

Significantly, each of these new processor types utilizes a fundamentally different model of computation, and this raises questions about how to best use such processors in the design and implementation of applications.

Still, some relatively simple algorithms have been shown to lead to surprisingly good empirical results in many contexts of interest. Perhaps the most prominent example is the success of the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks. Several recent works have pursued rigorous analytical justification for this phenomenon by studying the structure of the nonconvex optimization problems and establishing that simple algorithms, such as gradient descent and its variations, perform well in converging towards local minima and avoiding saddle-points. A key insight in these analyses is that gradient perturbations play a critical role in allowing local descent algorithms to efficiently distinguish desirable from undesirable stationary points and escape from the latter.

We show that in a local neighborhood of the optimal solution, the iterates generated by both DFP and BFGS converge to the optimal solution at a superlinear rate of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{1}{ {k}})^{k/2})$, where $k$ is the number of iterations.

We start in the point $v$ and construct a path from $v$ to $u$: at each step, we move to the neighbor for which $\phi$ is the smallest. This algorithm provably terminates and results in a short path from $v$ to $u$, often the shortest. The efficiency of this method is due to a discrete analogue of a phenomenon in Partial Differential Equations that is not well understood. We prove optimality for trees and discuss a number of open questions.},

  abstract    = {Extreme scale simulation requires fast and scalable algorithms, such as multigrid methods. To achieve asymptotically optimal complexity it is essential to employ a hierarchy of grids. The cost to solve the coarsest grid system can often be neglected in sequential computings, but cannot be ignored in massively parallel executions. In this case, the coarsest grid can be large and its efficient solution becomes a challenging task. We propose solving the coarse grid system using modern, approximate sparse direct methods and investigate the expected gains compared with traditional iterative methods. Since the coarse grid system only requires an approximate solution, we show that we can leverage block low-rank techniques, combined with the use of single precision arithmetic, to significantly reduce the computational requirements of the direct solver. In the case of extreme scale computing, the coarse grid system is too large for a sequential solution, but too small to permit massively parallel efficiency. We show that the agglomeration of the coarse grid system to a subset of processors is necessary for the sparse direct solver to achieve performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a Stokes-type saddle point system. We employ a monolithic Uzawa multigrid method. In particular, we show that the use of an approximate sparse direct solver for the coarse grid system can outperform that of a preconditioned minimal residual iterative method. This is demonstrated for the multigrid solution of systems of order up to 1+e11 degrees of freedom on a petascale supercomputer using 43 200 processes.}

  abstract    = {We revisit Matrix Balancing, a pre-conditioning task used ubiquitously for computing eigenvalues and matrix exponentials. Since 1960, Osborne's algorithm has been the practitioners' algorithm of choice, and is now implemented in most numerical software packages. However, the theoretical properties of Osborne's algorithm are not well understood. Here, we show that a simple random variant of Osborne's algorithm converges in near-linear time in the input sparsity. Specifically, it balances $K\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n\times n}$ after $O(m\epsilon^{-2}\log\kappa)$ arithmetic operations, where $m$ is the number of nonzeros in $K$, $\epsilon$ is the $\ell_1$ accuracy, and $\kappa=\sum_{ij}K_{ij}/(\min_{ij:K_{ij}\neq 0}K_{ij})$ measures the conditioning of $K$. Previous work had established near-linear runtimes either only for $\ell_2$ accuracy (a weaker criterion which is less relevant for applications), or through an entirely different algorithm based on (currently) impractical Laplacian solvers. We further show that if the graph with adjacency matrix $K$ is moderately connected--e.g., if $K$ has at least one positive row/column pair--then Osborne's algorithm initially converges exponentially fast, yielding an improved runtime $O(m\epsilon^{-1}\log\kappa)$. We also address numerical precision issues by showing that these runtime bounds still hold when using $O(\log(n\kappa/\epsilon))$-bit numbers. Our results are established through a potential argument that leverages a convex optimization perspective of Osborne's algorithm, and relates the per-iteration progress to the current imbalance as measured in Hellinger distance. Unlike previous analyses, we critically exploit log-convexity of the potential. Our analysis extends to other variants of Osborne's algorithm: along the way, we establish significantly improved runtime bounds for cyclic, greedy, and parallelized variants.},

  abstract    = {We revisit Min-Mean-Cycle, the classical problem of finding a cycle in a weighted directed graph with minimum mean weight. Despite an extensive algorithmic literature, previous work falls short of a near-linear runtime in the number of edges $m$--in fact, there is a natural barrier which precludes such a runtime for solving Min-Mean-Cycle exactly. Here, we give a much faster approximation algorithm that, for graphs with polylogarithmic diameter, has near-linear runtime. In particular, this is the first algorithm whose runtime for the complete graph scales in the number of vertices $n$ as $\tilde{O}(n^2)$. Moreover--unconditionally on the diameter--the algorithm uses only $O(n)$ memory beyond reading the input, making it "memory-optimal". The algorithm is also simple to implement and has remarkable practical performance. Our approach is based on solving a linear programming (LP) relaxation using entropic regularization, which effectively reduces the LP to a Matrix Balancing problem--a la the popular reduction of Optimal Transport to Matrix Scaling. We then round the fractional LP solution using a variant of the classical Cycle-Cancelling algorithm that is sped up to near-linear runtime at the expense of being approximate, and implemented in a memory-optimal manner. We also provide an alternative algorithm with slightly faster theoretical runtime, albeit worse memory usage and practicality. This algorithm uses the same rounding procedure, but solves the LP relaxation by leveraging recent developments in area-convexity regularization. Its runtime scales inversely in the approximation accuracy, which we show is optimal--barring a major breakthrough in algorithmic graph theory, namely faster Shortest Paths algorithms.},

In recent years, single-source and top-$k$ SimRank queries have received increasing attention due to their applications in web mining, social network analysis, and spam detection. However, a fundamental obstacle in studying SimRank has been the lack of ground truths. The only exact algorithm, Power Method, is computationally infeasible on graphs with more than $10^6$ nodes. Consequently, no existing work has evaluated the actual trade-offs between query time and accuracy on large real-world graphs. In this paper, we present ExactSim, the first algorithm that computes the exact single-source and top-$k$ SimRank results on large graphs. With high probability, this algorithm produces ground truths with a rigorous theoretical guarantee. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of ExactSim. The results show that ExactSim provides the ground truth for any single-source SimRank query with a precision up to 7 decimal places within a reasonable query time.},

However, a distributed optimization algorithm that is computationally efficient, globally convergent, amenable to nonconvex constraints and general inter-subsystem interactions remains an open problem. In this paper, we combine three important modifications to the classical alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for distributed optimization. Specifically, (i) an extra-layer architecture is adopted to accommodate nonconvexity and handle inequality constraints, (ii) equality-constrained nonlinear programming (NLP) problems are allowed to be solved approximately, and (iii) a modified Anderson acceleration is employed for reducing the number of iterations. Theoretical convergence towards stationary solutions and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, named ELLADA, is established. Its application to distributed nonlinear MPC is also described and illustrated through a benchmark process system.},

The main theoretical result shows that the RAD method enjoys the global linear convergence with high probability for such a class of nonconvex objectives, i.e., the method will not be trapped in saddle points, local minima, or even discontinuities. Besides, the method is derivative-free and its per-iteration cost, i.e., the number of function evaluations, is bounded, so that it has a complexity bound $\mathcal{O}(\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ for finding a point such that the optimality gap at this point is less than $\epsilon>0$.},

  abstract = {We propose two acceleration methods, namely Fused and Gram, for reducing outof-core data access when performing randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) on graphics processing units (GPUs). Out-of-core data here are data that are too large to fit into the GPU memory at once. Both methods accelerate GPU-enabled RSVD using the following three schemes: (1) a highly tuned general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) scheme for processing out-of-core data on GPUs; (2) a data-access reduction scheme based on one-dimensional (1D) data partition; and (3) a first-in, first-out (FIFO) scheme that reduces CPU-GPU data transfer using the reverse iteration. The Fused method further reduces the amount of out-of-core data access by merging two GEMM operations into a single operation. In contrast, the Gram method reduces both in-core and out-of-core data access by explicitly forming the Gram matrix. According to our experimental results, the Fused and Gram methods improved the RSVD performance by up to 1.7$\times$ and 5.2$\times$, respectively, compared with a straightforward method that deploys schemes (1) and (2) on the GPU. In addition, we present a case study of deploying the Gram method for accelerating robust principal component analysis (RPCA), a convex optimization problem in machine learning.}

There is a trade-off between solving Newton systems directly, which give high quality solutions, and solving many approximate Newton systems which are computationally less expensive but give lower quality solutions. We propose partial and full approximate solutions to the Newton systems, which in general involves solving a reduced system of linear equations. The specific approximate solution and the size of the reduced system that needs to be solved at each iteration are determined by estimates of the active and inactive constraints at the solution. These sets are at each iteration estimated by a simple heuristic. In addition, we motivate and suggest two modified-Newton approaches which are based on an intermediate step that consists of the partial approximate solutions. The theoretical setting is introduced and asymptotic error bounds are given along with numerical results for bound-constrained convex quadratic optimization problems, both random and from the CUTEst test collection.},

For data matrices drawn from the PSB data model, we provide computationally efficient factorization algorithms which recover the generating factors with high probability from as few as $N =O\left(\frac{n}{k}\log^2(n)\right)$ data vectors, where $k$, $m$ and $n$ scale proportionally.

  abstract    = {Recently, stochastic optimization methods are a class of powerful optimization tools in machine learning. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the representative stochastic methods and is widely used for many machine learning problems. However, SGD only uses the first-order information of problems to optimize them, which results in its some limitations such as its solutions without high accuracy. Thus, stochastic quasi-Newton methods recently have been widely concerned due to utilizing approximate Hessian information, which is more robust and can achieve better accuracy than stochastic first-order methods. Considering that existing stochastic quasi-Newton methods still do not reach the best known stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, thus, we propose a novel faster stochastic quasi-Newton method (SpiderSQN) based on the variance reduced technique of SIPDER. Moreover, we prove that our SpiderSQN method reach the best known SFO complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+n^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2})$ in the finite-sum setting to obtain an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point. To further improve its practical performance, we incorporate SpiderSQN with different effective momentum schemes. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are generalized to the online setting, and the corresponding SFO complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ is developed, which matches the existing best result. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SpiderSQN-type of algorithms outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for nonconvex optimization.},

Our focus here is to fnd the shortest path between any pair of nodes in a given undirected unweighted simple graph with the help of the sequence of powers of neighbourhood matrices. The authors recently introduced the concept of neighbourhood matrix as a novel representation of graphs using the neighbourhood sets of the vertices. In this article, an extension of the above work is presented by introducing a sequence of matrices, referred to as the sequence of powers of $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{M}(G)$. It is denoted it by $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{M}^{(l)} (G)=\left[ \eta^{l}_{ij}\right], 1 \le l \le k(G)$, where $k(G)$ is called the iteration number, $k(G) = \lceil \text{log}_2 \text{diameter}(G) \rceil$. As this sequence of matrices captures the distance between the nodes profoundly, we further develop the technique and present several characterizations. Based on the theoretical results, we present an algorithm to fnd the shortest path between any pair of nodes in a given graph. The proposed algorithm and the claims therein are formally validated through simulations on synthetic data and the real network data from Facebook.

A poor initial guess can contribute to non-convergence of these methods or lead these methods to converge to a wrong solution. In this paper, an initial guess free method is introduced to find the optimal parameter estimators in a nonlinear model that minimizes the squared error of the fit. The method includes three algorithms that require different level of computational power to find the optimal parameter estimators. The method constructs a solution interval for each parameter in the model. These solution intervals significantly reduce the search space for optimal parameter estimators. The method also provides an empirical probability distribution for each parameter, which is valuable for parameter uncertainty assessment. The initial guess free method is validated through a case study in which Fick's second law is fit to an experimental data set. This case study shows that the initial guess free method can find the optimal parameter estimators efficiently. A four-step procedure for implementing the initial guess free method in practice is also outlined.},

  abstract   = {Stochastic rounding rounds a real number to the next larger or smaller floatingpoint number with probabilities 1 minus the relative distances to those numbers. It is gaining attention in deep learning because it can improve the accuracy of the computations. We compare basic properties of stochastic rounding with those for round to nearest, finding properties in common as well as significant differences. We prove that for stochastic rounding the rounding errors are mean independent random variables with zero mean. We derive a new version of our probabilistic error analysis theorem from [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 41 (2019), pp. A2815–A2835], weakening the assumption of independence of the random variables to mean independence. These results imply that for a wide range of linear algebra computations the backward error for stochastic rounding is unconditionally bounded by a multiple of $\sqrt{n}u$ to first order, with a certain probability, where $n$ is the problem size and $u$ is the unit roundoff. This is the first scenario where the rule of thumb that one can replace nu by $\sqrt{n}u$ in a rounding error bound has been shown to hold without any additional assumptions on the rounding errors. We also explain how stochastic rounding avoids the phenomenon of stagnation in sums, whereby small addends are obliterated by round to nearest when they are too small relative to the sum.}

  abstract  = {F1oating-Point Units (FPUs) count as a significant part of computing resources in modern general-purpose and application-specific processors. Full-precision FPUs can be a source of extensive hardware overhead (power consumption, area, memory footprint etc.). On the other hand, several applications feature the inherent ability to tolerate precision loss. This has lead to the development of a new computing paradigm: Transprecision Computing (TC), where variable and arbitrary precision hardware FPUs have been introduced. Many tools and libraries have been proposed to simulate the effects of approximation on applications, to help designers to select the most optimized FPU architecture adequate for a given application.However, existing techniques require developers to rewrite part or all of their existing software stacks (applications, libraries, operating systems …), which is often infeasible, complex or at least a very time-consuming development effort.This work proposes a non-intrusive approach, which does not need source code modification, by introducing approximations at the low-level in assembly. This allows approximating virtually all kinds of executable binaries (bare-metal applications, single- /multi-threaded user applications, OS/RTOS, etc.).We implement the approach on top of the well known QEMU dynamic binary translator. We perform experiments on a set of benchmarks from the literature, and we demonstrate how the approach further simplifies evaluating the impact of FP approximations on numerical applications outputs, without being intrusive to the source code.},

Currently, these are the best known superlinear convergence rates for these methods. In particular, our results show that the starting moment of superlinear convergence of BFGS method depends on the logarithm of the condition number $\frac{L}{\mu}$ in the worst case.},

Surprisingly, this problem has a closed-form solution that can be computed efficiently, recovering the popular Vecchia approximation in spatial statistics. Based on recent results on the approximate sparsity of inverse Cholesky factors of $\Theta$ obtained from pairwise evaluation of Green's functions of elliptic boundary-value problems at points $\{x_{i}\}_{1 \leq i \leq N} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$, we propose an elimination ordering and sparsity pattern that allows us to compute $\epsilon$-approximate inverse Cholesky factors of such $\Theta$ in computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N/\epsilon)^d)$ in space and $\mathcal{O}(N \log(N/\epsilon)^{2d})$ in time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best asymptotic complexity for this class of problems. Furthermore, our method is embarrassingly parallel, automatically exploits low-dimensional structure in the data, and can perform Gaussian-process regression in linear (in $N$) space complexity. Motivated by the optimality properties of our methods, we propose methods for applying it to the joint covariance of training and prediction points in Gaussian-process regression, greatly improving stability and computational cost. Finally, we show how to apply our method to the important setting of Gaussian processes with additive noise, sacrificing neither accuracy nor computational complexity.},

Among all kinds of mesh types, unstructured meshes are dominant in engineering simulation scenarios and play an essential role in scientific computations for their geometrical flexibility. However, the high-fidelity applications based on unstructured grids are still time-consuming, no matter for programming or running.\\ This study develops an efficient UNstructured Acceleration Toolkit (UNAT), which provides friendly high-level programming interfaces and elaborates lower level implementation on the target hardware to get nearly hand-optimized performance. At the present state, two efficient strategies, a multi-level blocks method and a row-subsections method, are designed and implemented on Sunway architecture. Random memory access and write–write conflict issues of unstructured meshes have been handled by partitioning, coloring and other hardware-specific techniques. Moreover, a data-reuse mechanism is developed to increase the computational intensity and alleviate the memory bandwidth bottleneck.\\ The authors select sparse matrix-vector multiplication as a performance benchmark of UNAT across different data layouts and different matrix formats. Experimental results show that the speed-ups reach up to 26$\times$ compared to single management processing element, and the utilization ratio tests indicate the capability of achieving nearly hand-optimized performance. Finally, the authors adopt UNAT to accelerate a well-tuned unstructured solver and obtain speed-ups of 19$\times$ and 10$\times$ on average for main kernels and overall solver, respectively.\\ The authors design an unstructured mesh toolkit, UNAT, to link the hardware and numerical algorithm, and then, engineers can focus on the algorithms and solvers rather than the parallel implementation. For the many-core processor SW26010 of the fastest supercomputer in China, UNAT yields up to 26$\times$ speed-ups and achieves nearly hand-optimized performance.},

New and more complex architectures have been introduced in HPC systems to afford these new restrictions, and include coprocessors such as GPGPUs for intensive computational tasks. As systems increase in heterogeneity, workload distribution becomes a more core problem to achieve the maximum efficiency in every computational component. We present a Multi-Objective Dynamic Load Balancing (DLB) approach where several objectives can be applied to tune an application. These objectives can be dynamically exchanged during the execution of an algorithm to better adapt to the resources available in a system. We have implemented the Multi-Objective DLB together with a generic heuristic engine, designed to perform multiple strategies for DLB in iterative problems. We also present Ull Multiobjective Framework (UllMF), an open-source tool that implements the Multi-Objective generic approach. UllMF separates metric gathering, objective functions to be optimized and load balancing algorithms, and improves code portability using a simple interface to reduce the costs of new implementations. We illustrate how performance and energy consumption are improved for the implemented techniques, and analyze their quality using different DLB techniques from the literature.},

  pages     = {1--1},
  abstract  = {In this work, we examine a novel generic network cost minimization problem, in which every node has a local decision vector to optimize. Each node incurs a cost associated with its decision vector while each link incurs a cost related to the decision vectors of its two end nodes. All nodes collaborate to minimize the overall network cost. The formulated network cost minimization problem has broad applications in distributed signal processing and control, in which the notion of link costs often arises. To solve this problem in a decentralized manner, we develop a distributed variant of the Newton's method, which possesses faster convergence than alternative first order optimization methods such as gradient descent and alternating direction method of multipliers. The proposed method is based on an appropriate splitting of the Hessian matrix and an approximation of its inverse, which is used to determine the Newton step. Global linear convergence of the proposed algorithm is established under several standard technical assumptions on the local cost functions. Furthermore, analogous to classical centralized Newton's method, a quadratic convergence phase of the algorithm over a certain time interval is identified. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its superiority over other first order methods, especially when the cost functions are ill-conditioned. Complexity issues of the proposed distributed Newton's method and alternative first order methods are also discussed.},

A high-performance sparse tensor-vector product (SpTV), one of the most fundamental operations of processing sparse tensors, is necessary for improving efficiency of related applications. In this paper, we propose aeSpTV, an adaptive and efficient SpTV framework on Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer, to solve several challenges of optimizing SpTV on high-performance computing platforms. First, to map SpTV to Sunway architecture and tame expensive memory access latency and parallel writing conflict due to the intrinsic irregularity of SpTV, we introduce an adaptive SpTV parallelization. Second, to co-execute with the parallelization design while still ensuring high efficiency, we design a sparse tensor data structure named CSSoCR. Third, based on the adaptive SpTV parallelization with the novel tensor data structure, we present an auto-tuner that chooses the most befitting tensor partitioning method for aeSpTV using the variance analysis theory of mathematical statistics to achieve load balance. Fourth, to further leverage the computing power of Sunway, we propose customized optimizations for aeSpTV. Experimental results show that aeSpTV yields good sacalability on both thread-level and process-level parallelism of Sunway. It achieves a maximum GFLOPS of 195.69 on 128 processes. Additionally, it is proved that optimization effects of the partitioning auto-tuner and optimization techniques are remarkable.},

PCG requires only matrix-vector multiplications with $A$ and $\tilde{M}$ (not solving a linear system with $\tilde{M}$), and so too can be carried out in parallel. We compare it with incomplete Cholesky factorization (the gold standard for PCG) and with MATLAB's backslash operator (sparse Cholesky) on matrices from various applications.

Recent work has uncovered deep and fruitful connections between DPPs and RandNLA which lead to new guarantees and improved algorithms that are of interest to both areas. We provide an overview of this exciting new line of research, including brief introductions to RandNLA and DPPs, as well as applications of DPPs to classical linear algebra tasks such as least squares regression, low-rank approximation and the Nystr\"om method. For example, random sampling with a DPP leads to new kinds of unbiased estimators for least squares, enabling more refined statistical and inferential understanding of these algorithms; a DPP is, in some sense, an optimal randomized algorithm for the Nystr\"om method; and a RandNLA technique called leverage score sampling can be derived as the marginal distribution of a DPP. We also discuss recent algorithmic developments, illustrating that, while not quite as efficient as standard RandNLA techniques, DPP-based algorithms are only moderately more expensive.},

Many users depend on reproducibility for debugging or correctness. However, dynamic scheduling of parallel computing resources, with nonassociativity of floating-point addition, makes reproducibility a challenge even for summing a vector of numbers, or the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We describe an algorithm that computes a reproducible floating point sum, independent of summation order. The algorithm uses only a subset of IEEE Standard 754-2008. It is communication-optimal, i.e. it does just one pass over the data in the sequential case, or one reduction operation in parallel, requiring an \emph{accumulator} of just 6 words (higher precision is possible). The arithmetic cost is $7n$ additions to sum $n$ words, and the error bound can be up to $10^(-8)$ times smaller than for conventional summation. We describe the algorithm, the software infrastructure for reproducible BLAS (ReproBLAS), and performance results.

The expressions are then optimized by both the traditional compiler optimization techniques and specific tensor algebra transformations. Experimental results show that AutoHOOT achieves competitive performance for both tensor decomposition and tensor network applications compared to existing AD software and other tensor computation libraries with manually written kernels, both on CPU and GPU architectures. The scalability of the generated kernels is as good as other well-known high-order numerical algorithms so that it can be executed efficiently on distributed parallel systems.},

Existing approaches cannot supply certifiably optimal principal components with more than $p=100s$ covariates. By reformulating sparse PCA as a convex mixed-integer semidefinite optimization problem, we design a cutting-plane method which solves the problem to certifiable optimality at the scale of selecting k=10s covariates from p=300 variables, and provides small bound gaps at a larger scale. We also propose two convex relaxations and randomized rounding schemes that provide certifiably near-exact solutions within minutes for p=100s or hours for p=1,000s. Using real-world financial and medical datasets, we illustrate our approach's ability to derive interpretable principal components tractably at scale.},

  abstract  = {The goal of clustering is to partition a set of data points into groups of similar data points, called clusters. Clustering algorithms can be classified into two categories: hard and soft clustering. Hard clustering assigns each data point to one cluster exclusively. On the other hand, soft clustering allows probabilistic assignments to clusters. In this paper, we propose a new model which combines the benefits of these two models: clarity of hard clustering and probabilistic assignments of soft clustering. Since the majority of data usually have a clear association, only a few points may require a probabilistic interpretation. Thus, we apply the $\mathcal{l}_1$ norm constraint to impose sparsity on probabilistic assignments. Moreover, we also incorporate outlier detection in our clustering model to simultaneously detect outliers which can cause serious problems in statistical analyses. To optimize the model, we introduce an alternating minimization method and prove its convergence. Numerical experiments and comparisons with existing models show the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes and establishes the iteration-complexity of an inexact proximal accelerated augmented Lagrangian (IPAAL) method for solving linearly constrained smooth nonconvex composite optimization problems. Each IPAAL iteration consists of inexactly solving a proximal augmented Lagrangian subproblem by an accelerated composite gradient (ACG) method followed by a suitable Lagrange multiplier update. It is shown that IPAAL generates an approximate stationary solution in at most $O(\text{log}(1/\rho)/\rho^3)$ ACG iterations, where $\rho > 0$ is the given tolerance. It is also shown that the previous complexity bound can be sharpened to $O(\text{log}(1/\rho)/\rho^{2.5})$ under additional mildly stronger assumptions. The above bounds are derived assuming that the initial point is neither feasible nor the domain of the composite term of the objective function is bounded. Some preliminary numerical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the IPAAL method.}

First, we show that with the true gradient, policy gradient with a softmax parametrization converges at a $O(1/t)$ rate, with constants depending on the problem and initialization. This result significantly expands the recent asymptotic convergence results. The analysis relies on two findings: that the softmax policy gradient satisfies a \L{}ojasiewicz inequality, and the minimum probability of an optimal action during optimization can be bounded in terms of its initial value. Second, we analyze entropy regularized policy gradient and show that it enjoys a significantly faster linear convergence rate $O(e^{-t})$ toward softmax optimal policy. This result resolves an open question in the recent literature. Finally, combining the above two results and additional new $\Omega(1/t)$ lower bound results, we explain how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate. The separation of rates is further explained using the notion of non-uniform \L{}ojasiewicz degree. These results provide a theoretical understanding of the impact of entropy and corroborate existing empirical studies.},

In this paper, we revisit the popular large-scale spectral clustering method based on the anchor graph which is equivalent to the spectral decomposition on a similar matrix obtained using a second-order transition probability. However, due to the special structure of the bipartite graph, there is no stable distribution of the random walk process. The even-order transition probabilities may only a side view of the bipartite structure, resulting in breaking the independence of data points and leading to undesired artifacts for boundary samples. Therefore, we propose a Fast Spectral Clustering based on the Random Walk Laplacian (FRWL) method. The random walk Laplacian balances explicitly the popularity of anchors and the independence of data points, which keeps the structure of boundary samples. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.},

One can use $S$ instead of $D$ for machine learning algorithms. The reason is that the similarity matrix contains almost the same information about the data as the original matrix. This equivalence is the genesis of a large class of methods in machine learning, referred to as kernel methods. This chapter builds the linear algebra framework required for understanding this important class of methods in machine learning. The real utility of such methods arises when the similarity matrix is chosen differently from the use of dot products (and the data matrix is sometimes not even available).},

The condition number of the matrices can be arbitrarily chosen and large growth also happens for the transpose. No previous matrices with all these properties were known. The matrices can be generated by the MATLAB function \texttt{gallery('randsvd',..)}, and they are formed as the product of two random orthogonal matrices from the Haar distribution with a diagonal matrix having only one diagonal entry different from 1, which lies between 0 and 1 (the "one small singular value" case). Our explanation for the large growth uses the fact that the maximum absolute value of any element of a Haar distributed orthogonal matrix tends to be relatively small for large $n$. We verify the behavior numerically, finding that for partial pivoting the actual growth is significantly larger than the lower bound, and much larger than the growth observed for random matrices with elements from the uniform $[0, 1]$ or standard normal distributions. We show more generally that a rank-1 perturbation to an orthogonal matrix producing large growth for any form of pivoting also generates large growth under reasonable assumptions. Finally, we demonstrate that GMRES-based iterative refinement can provide stable solutions to $Ax = b$ when large growth occurs in low precision LU factors, even when standard iterative refinement cannot.}

Problem complexity and the sheer volume of data coming from various instruments and sensors motivate researchers to mix and match various approaches to optimize compute resources, including different levels of floating-point precision. In recent years, machine learning has motivated hardware support for halfprecision floating-point arithmetic. A primary challenge in high-performance computing is to leverage reducedprecision and mixed-precision hardware. We show how the FP16/FP32 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA GPUs can be exploited to accelerate the solution of linear systems of equations $Ax = b$ without sacrificing numerical stability. On the NVIDIA Quadro GV100 (Volta) GPU, we achieve a $4\times$ -- $5\times$ performance increase and $5\times$ better energy efficiency versus the standard FP64 implementation while maintaining an FP64 level of numerical stability.},

  abstract  = {Finding connected components is one of the most widely used operations on a graph. Optimal serial algorithms for the problem have been known for half a century, and many competing parallel algorithms have been proposed over the last several decades under various different models of parallel computation. This paper presents a class of parallel connected-component algorithms designed using linear-algebraic primitives. These algorithms are based on a PRAM algorithm by Shiloach and Vishkin and can be designed using standard GraphBLAS operations. We demonstrate two algorithms of this class, one named LACC for Linear Algebraic Connected Components, and the other named FastSV which can be regarded as LACC's simplification. With the support of the highly-scalable Combinatorial BLAS library, LACC and FastSV outperform the previous state-of-the-art algorithm by a factor of up to 12x for small to medium scale graphs. For large graphs with more than 50B edges, LACC and FastSV scale to 4K nodes (262K cores) of a Cray XC40 supercomputer and outperform previous algorithms by a significant margin. This remarkable performance is accomplished by (1) exploiting sparsity that was not present in the original PRAM algorithm formulation, (2) using high-performance primitives of Combinatorial BLAS, and (3) identifying hot spots and optimizing them away by exploiting algorithmic insights.},

The existing schemes usually preserve either only the global structure or local structure of the original data, but not both. To resolve this issue, a scheme called sparse locality for principal component analysis (SLPCA) is proposed. In order to effectively consider the trade-off between the complexity and efficiency, a robust $L_{2,p}$-norm-based principal component analysis (R2P-PCA) is introduced for global DR, while sparse representation-based locality preserving projection (SR-LPP) is used for local DR. Sparse representation is also employed to construct the weighted matrix of the samples. Being parameter-free, this allows the construction of an intrinsic graph more robust against the noise. In addition, simultaneous learning of projection matrix and sparse similarity matrix is possible. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms the existing schemes in terms of clustering accuracy and data reconstruction error.},

VBR consists of groups of adjacent rows and columns, storing the resulting blocks that contain nonzeros in a dense format. This reduces the memory footprint and enables optimizations such as register blocking and instruction-level parallelism. Existing approaches use heuristics to determine which rows and columns should be grouped together. We adapt and optimize a dynamic programming algorithm for sequential hypergraph partitioning to produce a linear time algorithm which can determine the optimal partition of rows under an expressive cost model, assuming the column partition remains fixed. Furthermore, we show that the problem of determining an optimal partition for the rows and columns simultaneously is NP-Hard under a simple linear cost model. To evaluate our algorithm empirically against existing heuristics, we introduce the 1D-VBR format, a specialization of VBR format where columns are left ungrouped. We evaluate our algorithms on all 1626 real-valued matrices in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection. When asked to minimize an empirically derived cost model for a sparse matrix-vector multiplication kernel, our algorithm produced partitions whose 1D-VBR realizations achieve a speedup of at least 1.18 over an unblocked kernel on 25\% of the matrices, and a speedup of at least 1.59 on 12.5\% of the matrices. The 1D-VBR representation produced by our algorithm had faster SpMVs than the 1D-VBR representations produced by any existing heuristics on 87.8\% of the test matrices.},

A number of concerns have been raised about correctness in such applications given the numerous gotchas the IEEE standard presents for developers, as well as the complexity of its implementation at the hardware and compiler levels. The standard and its implementations do provide mechanisms for analyzing floating point arithmetic as it executes, making it possible to find and track problematic operations. However, this capability is seldom used in practice. In response, we have developed FPSpy, a tool that provides this capability when operating underneath existing, unmodified x64 application binaries on Linux, including those using thread- and process-level parallelism. FPSpy can observe application behavior without any cooperation from the application or developer, and can potentially be deployed as part of a job launch process. We present the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of FPSpy. FPSpy operates conservatively, getting out of the way if the application itself begins to use any of the OS or hardware features that FPSpy depends on. Its overhead can be throttled, allowing a tradeoff between which and how many unusual events are to be captured, and the slowdown incurred by the application, with the low point providing virtually zero slowdown. We evaluated FPSpy by using it to methodically study seven widely-used applications/frameworks from a range of domains (five of which are in the NSF XSEDE top-20), as well as the NAS and PARSEC benchmark suites. All told, these comprise about 7.5 million lines of source code in a wide range of languages, and parallelism models (including OpenMP and MPI). FPSpy was able to produce trace information for all of them. The traces show that problematic floating point events occur in both the applications and the benchmarks. Analysis of the rounding behavior captured in our traces also suggests the feasibility of an approach to adding adaptive precision underneath existing, unmodified binaries.}

TPU-like accelerators are built upon a 2D array of MAC units and have demonstrated high throughput and efficiency for dense matrix multiplication, which is a key kernel in machine learning algorithms and is the target of the TPU. In this work, we employ a co-designed approach of first developing a packing technique to condense a sparse matrix and then propose a systolic array based system, Sparse-TPU, abbreviated to STPU, to accommodate the matrix computations for the packed denser matrix counterparts. To demonstrate the efficacy of our co-designed approach, we evaluate sparse matrix-vector multiplication on a broad set of synthetic and real-world sparse matrices. Experimental results show that STPU delivers 16.08$\times$ higher performance while consuming 4.39$\times$ and 19.79$\times$ lower energy for integer (int8) and floating point (float32) implementations, respectively, over a TPU baseline.

One way to achieve such a trade-off is precision tuning—that is, to modify the data types used for the computation by reducing the bit width, or by changing the representation from floating point to fixed point. We present a methodology for high-accuracy dynamic precision tuning based on the identification of input classes (i.e., classes of input datasets that benefit from similar optimizations). When a new input region is detected, the application kernels are re-compiled on the fly with the appropriate selection of parameters. In this way, we obtain a continuous optimization approach that enables the exploitation of the reduced precision computation while progressively exploring the solution space, thus reducing the time required by compilation overheads. We provide tools to support the automation of the runtime part of the solution, leaving to the user only the task of identifying the input classes. Our approach provides a significant performance boost (up to 320\%) on the typical approximate computing benchmarks, without meaningfully affecting the accuracy of the result, since the error remains always below 3\%.},

The method is inspired by the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) approach of {\it [Brunton et al., PNAS, 113 (15) (2016) 3932-3937]}, which relies on two main assumptions: the state variables are known {\it a priori} and the governing equations lend themselves to sparse, linear expansions in a (nonlinear) basis of the state variables. The aim of this work is to improve the accuracy and robustness of SINDy in the presence of state measurement noise. To this end, a reweighted $\ell_1$-regularized least squares solver is developed, wherein the regularization parameter is selected from the corner point of a Pareto curve. The idea behind using weighted $\ell_1$-norm for regularization -- instead of the standard $\ell_1$-norm -- is to better promote sparsity in the recovery of the governing equations and, in turn, mitigate the effect of noise in the state variables. We also present a method to recover single physical constraints from state measurements. Through several examples of well-known nonlinear dynamical systems, we demonstrate empirically the accuracy and robustness of the reweighted $\ell_1$-regularized least squares strategy with respect to state measurement noise, thus illustrating its viability for a wide range of potential applications.},

  abstract    = {The goal of the ExaWind project is to enable predictive simulations of wind farms comprised of many megawatt-scale turbines situated in complex terrain. Predictive simulations will require computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations for which the mesh resolves the geometry of the turbines and captures the rotation and large deflections of blades. Whereas such simulations for a single turbine are arguably petascale class, multi-turbine wind farm simulations will require exascale-class resources. The primary physics codes in the ExaWind project are Nalu-Wind, which is an unstructured-grid solver for the acoustically incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and OpenFAST, which is a whole-turbine simulation code. The Nalu-Wind model consists of the mass-continuity Poisson-type equation for pressure and a momentum equation for the velocity. For such modeling approaches, simulation times are dominated by linear-system setup and solution for the continuity and momentum systems. For the ExaWind challenge problem, the moving meshes greatly affect overall solver costs as reinitialization of matrices and recomputation of preconditioners is required at every time step.\\ In this report we evaluated GPU-performance baselines for the linear solvers in the Trilinos and hypre solver stacks using two representative Nalu-Wind simulations: an atmospheric boundary layer precursor simulation on a structured mesh, and a fixed-wing simulation using unstructured overset meshes. Both strong-scaling and weak-scaling experiments were conducted on the OLCF supercomputer Summit and similar proxy clusters. We focused on the performance of multi-threaded Gauss-Seidel and two-stage Gauss-Seidel that are extensions of classical Gauss-Seidel; of one-reduce GMRES, a communication-reducing variant of the Krylov GMRES; and algebraic multigrid methods that incorporate the afore-mentioned methods. The team has established that AMG methods are capable of solving linear systems arising from the fixed-wing overset meshes on CPU, a critical intermediate result for ExaWind FY20 Q3 and Q4 milestones. For the fixed-wing strong-scaling study (model with 3M grid-points), the team identified that Nalu-Wind simulations with the new Trilinos and hypre solvers scale to modest GPU counts, maintaining above 70\% efficiency up to 6 GPUs. However, there still remain significant bottlenecks to performance: matrix assembly (hypre), AMG setup (hypre and Trilinos) In the weak-scaling experiments (going from 0.4M to 211M gridpoints), it's shown that the solver apply phases are faster on GPUs, but that Nalu-Wind simulation times grow, primarily due to the multigrid-setup process.\\ Finally, based on the report outcomes, we propose a linear solver path-forward for the remainder of the ExaWind project. Near term, the NREL team will continue their work on GPU-based linear-system assembly. They will also investigate how the use of alternatives to the NVIDIA UVM (unified virtual memory) paradigm affects performance. Longer term, the NREL team will evaluate algorithmic performance on other types of accelerators and merge their improvements back to the main hypre repository branch. Near term, the Trilinos team will address performance bottlenecks identified in this milestone, such as implementing a GPU-based segregated momentum solve and reusing matrix graphs across linear-system assembly phases. Longer term, the Trilinos team will do detailed analysis and optimization of multigrid setup.}

  abstract  = {This paper proposes a coded distributed graph processing framework to alleviate the communication bottleneck in large-scale distributed graph processing. In particular, we propose a topology-aware coded computing (TACC) algorithm that has two novel salient features: (i) a topology-aware graph allocation strategy, and (ii) a coded aggregation scheme that combines the intermediate computations for graph processes while constructing coded messages. The proposed setup results in a trade-off between computation and communication, in that increasing the computation load at the distributed parties can in turn reduce the communication load. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the TACC algorithm by comparing the communication load with existing setups on both Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert type random graphs, as well as real-world Google web graph for PageRank computations. In particular, we show that the proposed coding strategy can lead to up to 82\% reduction in communication load and up to 46\% reduction overall execution time, when compared to the state-of-the-art and implemented on the Amazon EC2 cloud compute platform.},

Instead of solving the least squares problems directly, we transform them into a batch of saddle point linear systems and subsequently solve the linear systems using restrictively preconditioned conjugate gradient (RPCG) methods. Approximation of the new Schur complement is generated effectively based on a previously approximated Schur complement. Owing to the variations of the preconditioned conjugate gradient method, the proposed methods generate convergence results similar to the conjugate gradient method and achieve a very fast convergent iterative sequence when the coefficient matrix is well preconditioned. Numerical tests show that the new methods are more effective than some standard Krylov subspace methods. Updated RPCG methods meet the requirement of real-time computing successfully for multifactor models.},

Given the `flat' geometry around saddle points, first-order methods can struggle in escaping these regions in a fast manner due to the small magnitudes of gradients encountered. In particular, while it is known that gradient-related first-order methods escape strict-saddle neighborhoods, existing literature does not explicitly leverage the local geometry around saddle points in order to control behavior of gradient trajectories. It is in this context that this paper puts forth a rigorous geometric analysis of the gradient-descent method around strict-saddle neighborhoods using matrix perturbation theory. In doing so, it provides a key result that can be used to generate an approximate gradient trajectory for any given initial conditions. In addition, the analysis leads to a linear exit-time solution for gradient-descent method under certain necessary initial conditions for a class of strict-saddle functions.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {Sparsification, where the cut values of an input graph are approximately preserved by a sparse graph (called a cut sparsifier) or a succinct data structure (called a cut sketch), has been an influential tool in graph algorithms. But, this tool is restricted to undirected graphs, because some directed graphs are known to not admit sparsification. Such examples, however, are structurally very dissimilar to undirected graphs in that they exhibit highly unbalanced cuts. This motivates us to ask: can we sparsify a balanced digraph? To make this question concrete, we define balance $\beta$ of a digraph as the maximum ratio of the cut value in the two directions (Ene et al., STOC 2016). We show the following results: For-All Sparsification: If all cut values need to be simultaneously preserved (cf. Bencz\'ur and Karger, STOC 1996), then we show that the size of the sparsifier (or even cut sketch) must scale linearly with $\beta$. The upper bound is a simple extension of sparsification of undirected graphs (formally stated recently in Ikeda and Tanigawa (WAOA 2018)), so our main contribution here is to show a matching lower bound. For-Each Sparsification: If each cut value needs to be individually preserved (Andoni et al., ITCS 2016), then the situation is more interesting. Here, we give a cut sketch whose size scales with $\sqrt{\beta}$, thereby beating the linear lower bound above. We also show that this result is tight by exhibiting a matching lower bound of $\sqrt{\beta}$ on "for-each" cut sketches. Our upper bounds work for general weighted graphs, while the lower bounds even hold for unweighted graphs with no parallel edges.},

  abstract  = {In modern scientific computing, the execution of floating-point operations emerges as a major contributor to the energy consumption of a compute-intensive application with a large dynamic range. Experimental evidence shows that over 50\% of the energy consumed by a core and its data memory is related to floating-point computations. The adoption of floating-point formats requiring lesser number of bits is an interesting opportunity to reduce the energy consumption as it allows simplification of the arithmetic circuitry and reduces the memory bandwidth required to transfer the data between memory and registers. In theory, the adoption of multiple floating-point types following the principle of transprecision computing allows fine-grained control of floating-point arithmetic while meeting the desired standards on the accuracy of the final result. In this paper, the power-performance trade-offs for computing at different precision levels are analyzed for a parallel and distributed framework based on recovery-assisted discontinuous Galerkin (RADG) methods. The recovery operator of the RADG, operates on compact support from neighboring elements and allows high-order approximation of the solution, with potential for massive parallelism. Using PoLiMEr – a power monitoring and management tool for HPC applications – fine-grained insights into the power characteristics of the RADG code on the supercomputer Theta at Argonne National Laboratory are presented. 3D benchmark tests indicate a savings of approximately 5 W per node with single precision computing. A mixed precision approach where all computations except recovery operation is performed in single precision shows promising results, however, an automated approach for tuning floating-point types and analyzing the floating-point sensitivity of variables and operations is desirable.},

In particular, to address the lack of store buffers in GPUs, which causes both checkpoint storage overwriting and the high cost of checkpointing stores, Penny provides several compiler optimizations such as storage coloring and checkpoint pruning. Across 25 benchmarks, Penny causes only $\approx$3\% run-time overhead on average.},

Further, we describe a performance model based on these estimates that applies to bandwidth-limited computations.

  abstract  = {We design and develop a new high performance implementation of a fast direct LU-based solver using low-rank approximations on massively parallel systems. The LU factorization is the most time-consuming step in solving systems of linear equations in the context of analyzing acoustic scattering from large 3D objects. The matrix equation is obtained by discretizing the boundary integral of the exterior Helmholtz problem using a higher-order Nyström scheme. The main idea is to exploit the inherent data sparsity of the matrix operator by performing local tile-centric approximations while still capturing the most significant information. In particular, the proposed LU-based solver leverages the Tile Low-Rank (TLR) data compression format as implemented in the Hierarchical Computations on Manycore Architectures (HiCMA) library to decrease the complexity of “classical” dense direct solvers from cubic to quadratic order. We taskify the underlying boundary integral kernels to expose fine-grained computations. We then employ the dynamic runtime system StarPU to orchestrate the scheduling of computational tasks on shared and distributed-memory systems. The resulting asynchronous execution permits to compensate for the load imbalance due to the heterogeneous ranks, while mitigating the overhead of data motion. We assess the robustness of our TLR LU-based solver and study the qualitative impact when using different numerical accuracies. The new TLR LU factorization outperforms the state-of-the-art dense factorizations by up to an order of magnitude on various parallel systems, for analysis of scattering from large-scale 3D synthetic and real geometries.}

In this work we compare the performance of two methods: the first one is based on the well known Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) which involves regularization with an $\mathcal{l}$1 norm; the second one is the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) which is based on a Bayesian implementation of the linear logistic model. The two methods are extensively compared in this paper, on real and simulated datasets. Results show that, in general, the two approaches are comparable in terms of prediction performance. RVM outperforms the LASSO both in term of structure recovery (estimation of the correct non-zero model coefficients) and prediction accuracy when the dimensionality of the data tends to increase. However, LASSO shows comparable performance to RVM when the dimensionality of the data is much higher than number of samples that is $p \gg n$},

In this paper we propose a novel approach to mitigate this problem, by exploiting a low rank assumption regarding the (weighted) adjacency matrix of a DAG causal model. We establish several useful results relating interpretable graphical conditions to the low rank assumption, and show how to adapt existing methods for causal structure learning to take advantage of this assumption. We also provide empirical evidence for the utility of our low rank algorithms, especially on graphs that are not sparse. Not only do they outperform state-of-the-art algorithms when the low rank condition is satisfied, the performance on randomly generated scale-free graphs is also very competitive even though the true ranks may not be as low as is assumed.},

  abstract    = {Generalizable approaches, models, and frameworks for irregular application scalability is an old yet open area in parallel and distributed computing research. Irregular applications are particularly hard to parallelize and distribute because, by definition, the pattern of computation is dependent upon the input data. With the proliferation of data-driven and data-intensive applications from the realm of Big Data, and the increasing demand for and availability of large-scale computing resources through HPC-Cloud convergence, the importance of generalized approaches to achieving irregular application scalability is only growing.\\ Rather than offering another software language or framework, this dissertation argues we first need to understand application scalability, especially irregular application scalability, and more closely examine patterns of computation, data sharing, and dependencies. As it stands, predominant performance models and tools from parallel and distributed computing focus on applications that are divided into distinct communication and computation phases, and ignore issues related to memory utilization. While time-tested and valuable, these models are not always sucient for understanding full application scalability, particularly, the scalability of data-intensive irregular applications. We present application case studies from genomics, highlighting the interdependencies of communication, computation, and memory capacities and performance.\\ The genomics applications we will examine offer a particularly useful and practical vantage point for this analysis, as they are data-intensive irregular application targets for both HPC and cloud computing. Further, they present an extreme for both domains. For HPC, they are less akin to traditional, well-studied and well-supported scientific simulations and more akin to text and document analysis applications. For cloud computing, they are an extreme in that they require frequent random global access to memory and data, stressing interconnection network latency and bandwidth and co-scheduled processors for tightly orchestrated computation.\\ We show how common patterns of irregular all-to-all computation can be managed eciently, comparing bulk-synchronous approaches built on collective communication and asynchronous approaches based on one-sided communication. For the former, our work is based on the popular Message Passing Interface (MPI) and makes heavy use of globally collective communication operations that exchange data across processors in a single step or, to save memory use, in a set of irregular steps. For the latter, we build on the UPC++ programming framework, which provides lightweight RPC mechanisms, to transfer both data and computational work between processors. We present performance results across multiple platforms including several modern HPC systems and, at least in one case, a cloud computing platform. With these application case studies, we seek not only to contribute to discussions around parallel algorithm and data structure design, programming systems, and performance modeling within the parallel computing community, but also to contribute to broader work in genomics through software development and analysis. Thus, we develop and present the first distributed memory scalable software for analyzing data sets from the latest generation of sequencing technologies, known as long read data sets. Specifically, we present scalable solutions to the problem of many-to-many long read overlap and alignment, the computational bottleneck to long read assembly, error correction, and direct analysis. Through cross-architectural empirical analysis, we identify the key components to ecient scalability, and highlight the priorities for any future optimization with analytical models.}

  abstract  = {Space fractional diffusion models generally lead to dense discrete matrix operators, which lead to substantial computational challenges when the system size becomes large. For a state of size $N$, full representation of a fractional diffusion matrix would require $O(N^2)$ memory storage requirement, with a similar estimate for matrix–vector products. In this work, we present $\mathcal{H}^2$ matrix representation and algorithms that are amenable to efficient implementation on GPUs, and that can reduce the cost of storing these operators to $O(N)$ asymptotically. Matrix–vector multiplications can be performed in asymptotically linear time as well. Performance of the algorithms is assessed in light of 2D simulations of space fractional diffusion equation with constant diffusivity. Attention is focused on smooth particle approximation of the governing equations, which lead to discrete operators involving explicit radial kernels. The algorithms are first tested using the fundamental solution of the unforced space fractional diffusion equation in an unbounded domain, and then for the steady, forced, fractional diffusion equation in a bounded domain. Both matrix-inverse and pseudo-transient solution approaches are considered in the latter case. Our experiments show that the construction of the fractional diffusion matrix, the matrix–vector multiplication, and the generation of an approximate inverse pre-conditioner all perform very well on a single GPU on 2D problems with $N$ in the range $10^5 -- 10^6$. In addition, the tests also showed that, for the entire range of parameters and fractional orders considered, results obtained using the $\mathcal{H}^2$ approximations were in close agreement with results obtained using dense operators, and exhibited the same spatial order of convergence. Overall, the present experiences showed that the $\mathcal{H}^2$ matrix framework promises to provide practical means to handle large-scale space fractional diffusion models in several space dimensions, at a computational cost that is asymptotically similar to the cost of handling classical diffusion equations.},

  abstract    = {Optimization problems with uncertain black-box constraints, modeled by warped Gaussian processes, have recently been considered in the Bayesian optimization setting. This work introduces a new class of constraints in which the same black-box function occurs multiple times evaluated at different domain points. Such constraints are important in applications where, e.g., safety-critical measures are aggregated over multiple time periods. Our approach, which uses robust optimization, reformulates these uncertain constraints into deterministic constraints guaranteed to be satisfied with a specified probability, i.e., deterministic approximations to a chance constraint. This approach extends robust optimization methods from parametric uncertainty to uncertain functions modeled by warped Gaussian processes. We analyze convexity conditions and propose a custom global optimization strategy for non-convex cases. A case study derived from production planning and an industrially relevant example from oil well drilling show that the approach effectively mitigates uncertainty in the learned curves. For the drill scheduling example, we develop a custom strategy for globally optimizing integer decisions.},

  abstract  = {HPC has undergone a significant transition toward heterogeneous architectures. This transition has introduced several issues in code migration to support multiple frameworks for targeting the various architectures. In order to cope with these challenges, projects such as Kokkos and LLVM create abstractions which map a generic front-end API to the backend that supports the targeted architecture. This paper presents a complementary framework for performance measurement and analysis. Several performance measurement and analysis tools in existence provide their capabilities through various methods but the common theme among these tools are prohibitive limitations in terms of user-level extensions. For this reason, software developers commonly have to learn multiple tools and valuable analysis methods, such as the roofline model, are frequently required to be generated manually. The timemory framework provides complete modularity for performance measurement and analysis and eliminates all restrictions on user-level extensions. The timemory framework also provides a highly-efficient and intuitive method for handling multiple tools/measurements (i.e., "components") concurrently. The intersection of these characteristics provide ample evidence that timemory can serve as the common interface for existing performance measurement and analysis tools. Timemory components are developed in C++ but includes multi-language support for C, Fortran, and Python codes. Numerous components are provided by the library itself – including, but not limited to, timers, memory usage, hardware counters, and FLOP and instruction roofline models. Additionally, analysis of the intrinsic overhead demonstrates superior performance in comparison with popular tools.},

  abstract  = {Modern microprocessors suffer from increased error rates that come along with fabrication technology scaling. Processor designs continuously become more prone to hardware faults that lead to execution errors and system failures, which raise the requirement of protection mechanisms. However, error mitigation strategies have to be applied diligently, as they impose significant power, area, and performance overheads. Early and accurate reliability estimation of a microprocessor design is essential in order to determine the most vulnerable hardware structures and the most efficient protection schemes. One of the most commonly used techniques for reliability estimation is Architecturally Correct Execution (ACE) analysis.ACE analysis can be applied at different abstraction models, including microarchitecture and RTL and often requires a single or few simulations to report the Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF) of the processor structures. However, ACE analysis overestimates the vulnerability of structures because of its pessimistic, worst-case nature. Moreover, it only delivers coarse-grain vulnerability reports and no details about the expected result of hardware faults (silent data corruptions, crashes). In this paper, we present reverse ACE (rACE), a methodology that (a) improves the accuracy of ACE analysis and (b) delivers fine-grain error outcome reports. Using a reverse-order tracing flow, rACE analysis associates portions of the simulated execution of a program with the actual output and the control flow, delivering finer accuracy and results classification. Our findings show that rACE reports an average 1.45$\times$ overestimation, compared to Statistical Fault Injection, for different sizes of the register file of an out-of-order CPU core (executing both ARM and x86 binaries), when a baseline ACE analysis reports 2.3$\times$ overestimation and even refined versions of ACE analysis report an average of 1.8$\times$ overestimation.},

In addition to achieving exascale performance at a stringent power budget, it is imperative for GPUs to provide reliable computing guarantees to the end user. In current commodity systems, such guarantees are often achieved by incurring high protection cost in terms of performance, power, and hardware resources. However, we argue that these strict guarantees are often not required (and that the associated protected overheads can be significantly reduced) because several GPGPU applications are either fault-tolerant or can accept a quantifiable loss in output quality. To this end, this paper characterizes in a hierarchical manner the accuracy-aware resilience of GPGPU applications consisting of thousands of threads. This characterization study shows that accuracy-aware error resilience exhibits several interesting patterns across threads at different hierarchies (i.e., kernel/thread-block/warp). The insights from this characterization study can be used to reduce the overheads of expensive protection or recovery mechanisms that are typically used by GPUs to ensure application reliability.}

  abstract    = {In this thesis, two distinct problems in data-driven computational science are considered. The main problem of interest is the multiobjective optimization problem, where the tradeoff surface (called the Pareto front) between multiple conflicting objectives must be approximated in order to identify designs that balance real-world tradeoffs. In order to solve multiobjective optimization problems that are derived from computationally expensive blackbox functions, such as engineering design optimization problems, several methodologies are combined, including surrogate modeling, trust region methods, and adaptive weighting. The result is a numerical software package that finds approximately Pareto optimal solutions that are evenly distributed across the Pareto front, using minimal cost function evaluations. The second problem of interest is the closely related problem of multivariate interpolation, where an unknown response surface representing an underlying phenomenon is approximated by finding a function that exactly matches available data. To solve the interpolation problem, a novel algorithm is proposed for computing only a sparse subset of the elements in the Delaunay triangulation, as needed to compute the Delaunay interpolant. For high-dimensional data, this reduces the time and space complexity of Delaunay interpolation from exponential time to polynomial time in practice. For each of the above problems, both serial and parallel implementations are described. Additionally, both solutions are demonstrated on real-world problems in computer system performance modeling.}

  abstract    = {Subgraph matching is a basic task in querying graph dataset. It can also be called subgraph isomorphism search which consists to find all embeddings of a small query graph in a large data graph. It is one of the key techniques for understanding the underlying structure of graph datasets.\\ Graphs have been used to provide meaningful representations of objects and patterns, as well as more abstract descriptions. The representative power of graphs lies in their ability to characterize multiple pieces of information, as well as the relationships between them. Because of those properties, graph data structures have been leveraged in a wide spectrum of applications including social media, the World Wide Web, biological and genetic interactions, cyber network, co-author networks, citations, etc.. And at the heart of graph theory is the problem of graph matching, which attempts to find a way to map one graph onto another in such a way that both the topological structure and the node and edge labels are matched. For domains where data is noisy, an identical match may not be possible, so an inexact graph matching algorithm is used to search for the closest match, minimizing some similarity function.\\ There have been two completely different directions for supporting subgraph pattern matching. One direction is to develop specialized query processing engines, while the other direction is to develop efficient subgraph isomorphism algorithms for general, labeled graphs. Previously, both directions target distributed CPU systems. But the expensive network transfer overhead becomes a bottleneck. In order to explore the efficiency and parallel abilities of a single computer, we address latter direction of Subgraph Matching.\\ Most of previous works of subgraph matching fall into three classes of approaches: depth-first tree search, constraint propagation and graph indexing, all of which are not efficient on GPUs. Former intention to run subgraph matching on GPUs only targets a specific application and turns out to be memory-bounded. My research intends to tackle the bottleneck and further make subgraph matching meet the needs of a great spectrum of real-world applications.}

Unfortunately, computation with such irregular data structures is a poor match to the dominant imperative, bulk-synchronous parallel programming model. In this paper, we focus on the critical element of block-sparse tensor algebra, namely binary tensor contraction, and report on an efficient and scalable implementation using the task-focused PaRSEC runtime.

While half-precision has been driven largely by machine learning applications, recent algorithmic advances in numerical linear algebra have discovered beneficial use cases for half precision in accelerating the solution of linear systems of equations at higher precisions. In this paper, we present a high-performance, mixed-precision linear solver ($Ax=b$) for symmetric positive definite systems in double-precision using graphics processing units (GPUs). The solver is based on a mixed-precision Cholesky factorization that utilizes the high-performance tensor core units in CUDA-enabled GPUs. Since the Cholesky factors are affected by the low precision, an iterative refinement (IR) solver is required to recover the solution back to double-precision accuracy. Two different types of IR solvers are discussed on a wide range of test matrices. A preprocessing step is also developed, which scales and shifts the matrix, if necessary, in order to preserve its positive-definiteness in lower precisions. Our experiments on the V100 GPU show that performance speedups are up to 4.7$\times$  against a direct double-precision solver. However, matrix properties such as the condition number and the eigenvalue distribution can affect the convergence rate, which would consequently affect the overall performance.},

It makes use of C++ template meta-programming techniques to implement quantum algorithms as generic, platform-independent expressions, which get automatically synthesized into device-specific compute kernels upon execution. Our software framework supports concurrent and asynchronous execution of multiple quantum kernels via a CUDA-inspired stream concept.},

  doi       = {10.1007/s12532-020-00188-1},
  abstract  = {The computation of an initial basis is of great importance for simplex algorithms since it determines to a large extent the number of iterations and the computational effort needed to solve linear programs. We propose three algorithms that aim to construct an initial basis that is sparse and will reduce the fill-in and computational effort during LU factorization and updates that are utilized in modern simplex implementations. The algorithms rely on triangulation and fill-reducing ordering techniques that are invoked prior to LU factorization. We compare the performance of the CPLEX 12.6.1 primal and dual simplex algorithms using the proposed starting bases against CPLEX using its default crash procedure over a set of 95 large benchmarks (NETLIB, Kennington, Mészáros, Mittelmann). The best proposed algorithm utilizes METIS (Karypis and Kumar in SIAM J Sci Comput 20:359–392, 1998), produces remarkably sparse starting bases, and results in 5\% reduction of the geometric mean of the execution time of CPLEX's primal simplex algorithm. Although the proposed algorithm improves CPLEX's primal simplex algorithm across all problem types studied in this paper, it performs better on hard problems, i.e., the instances for which the CPLEX default requires over 1000 s. For these problems, the proposed algorithm results in 37\% reduction of the geometric mean of the execution time of CPLEX's primal simplex algorithm. The proposed algorithm also reduces the execution time of CPLEX's dual simplex on hard instances by 10\%. For the instances that are most difficult for CPLEX, and for which CPLEX experiences numerical difficulties as it approaches the optimal solution, the best proposed algorithm speeds up CPLEX by more than 10 times. Finally, the proposed algorithms lead to a natural way to parallelize CPLEX with speedups over CPLEX's dual simplex of 1.2 and 1.3 on two and four cores, respectively.},

  abstract    = {The ubiquity of massive graph data sets in numerous applications requires fast algorithms for extracting knowledge from these data. We are motivated here by three electrical measures for the analysis of large small-world graphs $G = (V, E)$ -- i.e., graphs with diameter in $O(\log |V|)$, which are abundant in complex network analysis. From a computational point of view, the three measures have in common that their crucial component is the diagonal of the graph Laplacian's pseudoinverse, $L^\dagger$. Computing diag$(L^\dagger)$ exactly by pseudoinversion, however, is as expensive as dense matrix multiplication -- and the standard tools in practice even require cubic time. Moreover, the pseudoinverse requires quadratic space -- hardly feasible for large graphs. Resorting to approximation by, e.g., using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, requires the solution of $O(\log |V| / \epsilon^2)$ Laplacian linear systems to guarantee a relative error, which is still very expensive for large inputs. In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm that requires the solution of only one Laplacian linear system. The remaining parts are purely combinatorial -- mainly sampling uniform spanning trees, which we relate to diag$(L^\dagger)$ via effective resistances. For small-world networks, our algorithm obtains a $\pm \epsilon$-approximation with high probability, in a time that is nearly-linear in $|E|$ and quadratic in $1 / \epsilon$. Another positive aspect of our algorithm is its parallel nature due to independent sampling. We thus provide two parallel implementations of our algorithm: one using OpenMP, one MPI + OpenMP. In our experiments against the state of the art, our algorithm (i) yields more accurate results, (ii) is much faster and more memory-efficient, and (iii) obtains good parallel speedups, in particular in the distributed setting.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {Min-max optimization, with a nonconvex-nonconcave objective function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, arises in many areas, including optimization, economics, and deep learning. The nonconvexity-nonconcavity of $f$ means that the problem of finding a global $\varepsilon$-min-max point cannot be solved in $\mathrm{poly}(d, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ evaluations of $f$. Thus, most algorithms seek to obtain a certain notion of local min-max point where, roughly speaking, each player optimizes her payoff in a local sense. However, the classes of local min-max solutions which prior algorithms seek are only guaranteed to exist under very strong assumptions on $f$, such as convexity or monotonicity. We propose a notion of a greedy equilibrium point for min-max optimization and prove the existence of such a point for any function such that it and its first three derivatives are bounded. Informally, we say that a point $(x^\star, y^\star)$ is an $\varepsilon$-greedy min-max equilibrium point of a function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if $y^\star$ is a second-order local maximum for $f(x^\star,\cdot)$ and, roughly, $x^\star$ is a local minimum for a greedy optimization version of the function $\max_y f(x,y)$ which can be efficiently estimated using greedy algorithms. The existence follows from an algorithm that converges from any starting point to such a point in a number of gradient and function evaluations that is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$, the dimension $d$, and the bounds on $f$ and its first three derivatives. Our results do not require convexity, monotonicity, or special starting points.},

  abstract    = {We propose a new globally convergent stochastic second order method. Our starting point is the development of a new Sketched Newton-Raphson (SNR) method for solving large scale nonlinear equations of the form $F(x)=0$ with $F: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$. We then show how to design several stochastic second order optimization methods by re-writing the optimization problem of interest as a system of nonlinear equations and applying SNR. For instance, by applying SNR to find a stationary point of a generalized linear model (GLM), we derive completely new and scalable stochastic second order methods. We show that the resulting method is very competitive as compared to state-of-the-art variance reduced methods. Using a variable splitting trick, we also show that the Stochastic Newton method (SNM) is a special case of SNR, and use this connection to establish the first global convergence theory of SNM. Indeed, by showing that SNR can be interpreted as a variant of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method we are able to leverage proof techniques of SGD and establish a global convergence theory and rates of convergence for SNR. As a special case, our theory also provides a new global convergence theory for the original Newton-Raphson method under strictly weaker assumptions as compared to what is commonly used for global convergence. There are many ways to re-write an optimization problem as nonlinear equations. Each re-write would lead to a distinct method when using SNR. As such, we believe that SNR and its global convergence theory will open the way to designing and analysing a host of new stochastic second order methods.},

This setting allows us to get further insight into the potential of multilevel optimization methods. Indeed, when the least squares problem arises from the training of artificial neural networks, the variables subject to optimization are not related by any geometrical constraints and the standard interpolation and restriction operators cannot be employed any longer. A heuristic, inspired by algebraic multigrid methods, is then proposed to construct the multilevel transfer operators. We test the new optimizer on an important application: the approximate solution of partial differential equations by means of artificial neural networks. The learning problem is formulated as a least squares problem, choosing the nonlinear residual of the equation as a loss function, whereas the multilevel method is employed as a training method. Numerical experiments show encouraging results related to the efficiency of the new multilevel optimization method compared to the corresponding one-level procedure in this context.},

This is the first book to detail conjugate gradient methods, showing their properties and convergence characteristics as well as their performance in solving large-scale unconstrained optimization problems and applications. Comparisons to the limited-memory and truncated Newton methods are also discussed. Topics studied in detail include: linear conjugate gradient methods, standard conjugate gradient methods, acceleration of conjugate gradient methods, hybrid, modifications of the standard scheme, memoryless BFGS preconditioned, and three-term. Other conjugate gradient methods with clustering the eigenvalues or with the minimization of the condition number of the iteration matrix, are also treated. For each method, the convergence analysis, the computational performances and the comparisons versus other conjugate gradient methods are given. \\ The theory behind the conjugate gradient algorithms presented as a methodology is developed with a clear, rigorous, and friendly exposition; the reader will gain an understanding of their properties and their convergence and will learn to develop and prove the convergence of his/her own methods. Numerous numerical studies are supplied with comparisons and comments on the behavior of conjugate gradient algorithms for solving a collection of 800 unconstrained optimization problems of different structures and complexities with the number of variables in the range [1000,10000].  The book is addressed to all those interested in developing and using new advanced techniques for solving unconstrained optimization complex problems. Mathematical programming researchers, theoreticians and practitioners in operations research, practitioners in engineering and industry researchers, as well as graduate students in mathematics, Ph.D. and master students in mathematical programming, will find plenty of information and practical applications for solving large-scale unconstrained optimization problems and applications by conjugate gradient methods.},

We provide a theoretical analysis that accurately characterizes the expected convergence gains of repartitioning and validate our findings empirically on various traditional machine learning tasks. From an implementation perspective, block separable models are well suited for parallelization and, when shared memory is available, randomization can be implemented on top of existing methods very efficiently to improve convergence.},

At each iteration, the subspace is chosen randomly either uniformly or by a probability proportional to the local Lipschitz constants. Then in each chosen subspace, a preconditioned gradient descent method is applied. RFASD converges sublinearly for convex functions and linearly for strongly convex functions. Comparing with the randomized block coordinate descent methods, the convergence of RFASD is faster provided $\kappa_A$ is small and the subspace decomposition is $A$-stable. This improvement is supported by considering a multilevel space decomposition for Nesterov's `worst' problem.},

Parallel SpGEMM algorithms are classified under one-dimensional (1D), 2D, and 3D categories denoting the number of dimensions by which the 3D sparse workcube representing the iteration space of SpGEMM is partitioned. Recently proposed successful 2D- and 3D-parallel SpGEMM algorithms benefit from upper bounds on communication overheads enforced by 2D and 3D cartesian partitioning of the workcube on 2D and 3D virtual processor grids, respectively. However, these methods are based on random cartesian partitioning and do not utilize sparsity patterns of SpGEMM instances for reducing the communication overheads. We propose hypergraph models for 2D and 3D cartesian partitioning of the workcube for further reducing the communication overheads of these 2D- and 3D- parallel SpGEMM algorithms. The proposed models utilize two- and three-phase partitioning that exploit multi-constraint hypergraph partitioning formulations. Extensive experimentation performed on 20 SpGEMM instances by using upto 900 processors demonstrate that proposed partitioning models significantly improve the scalability of 2D and 3D algorithms. For example, in 2D-parallel SpGEMM algorithm on 900 processors, the proposed partitioning model respectively achieves 85 and 42 percent decrease in total volume and total number of messages, leading to 1.63 times higher speedup compared to random partitioning, on average.},

To this end, the randomized shortest path formalism (RSP, [2,99,124]) is rephrased in terms of Tsallis divergence regularization, instead of Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main consequence of this change is that the resulting routing policy (local transition probabilities) becomes sparser when T decreases, therefore inducing a sparse random walk on G converging to the least-cost directed acyclic graph when T tends to 0. Experimental comparisons on node clustering and semi-supervised classification tasks show that the derived dissimilarity measures based on expected routing costs provide state-of-the-art results. The sparse RSP is therefore a promising model of movements on a graph, balancing sparse exploitation and exploration in an optimal way.},

The new approach halves the number of Conjugate Gradient iterations needed for convergence, with almost the same factorization complexity, improving the total runtimes of the algorithm. Our approach can be incorporated into other rank-structured methods for solving sparse linear systems.},

  abstract    = {Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a surrogate-assisted global optimization technique that has been successfully applied in various fields, e.g., automated machine learning and design optimization. Built upon a so-called infill-criterion and Gaussian Process regression (GPR), the BO technique suffers from a substantial computational complexity and hampered convergence rate as the dimension of the search spaces increases. Scaling up BO for high-dimensional optimization problems remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose to tackle the scalability of BO by hybridizing it with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), resulting in a novel PCA-assisted BO (PCA-BO) algorithm. Specifically, the PCA procedure learns a linear transformation from all the evaluated points during the run and selects dimensions in the transformed space according to the variability of evaluated points. We then construct the GPR model, and the infill-criterion in the space spanned by the selected dimensions. We assess the performance of our PCA-BO in terms of the empirical convergence rate and CPU time on multi-modal problems from the COCO benchmark framework. The experimental results show that PCA-BO can effectively reduce the CPU time incurred on high-dimensional problems, and maintains the convergence rate on problems with an adequate global structure. PCA-BO therefore provides a satisfactory trade-off between the convergence rate and computational efficiency opening new ways to benefit from the strength of BO approaches in high dimensional numerical optimization.},

For a sparse matrix, LU decomposition often introduces more nonzero entries in the L and U factors than the original matrix. Symbolic factorization step is needed to identify the nonzero structures of L and U matrices. Attracted by the enormous potentials of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), an array of efforts has surged to deploy various steps of LU factorization on GPUs except, to the best of our knowledge, symbolic factorization.This paper introduces GSoFa, a GPU based Symbolic factorization design with the following three optimizations to enable scalable LU symbolic factorization for nonsymmetric pattern sparse matrices on GPUs. First, we introduce a novel fine-grained parallel symbolic factorization algorithm that is well suited for the Single Instruction Multiple Thread (SIMT) architecture of GPUs. Second, we propose multi-source concurrent symbolic factorization to improve the utilization of GPUs with focus on balancing the workload. Third, we introduce a three-pronged optimization to reduce the excessive space requirement faced by multi-source concurrent symbolic factorization. Taken together, this work scales LU symbolic factorization towards 1,000 GPUs with superior performance over the state-of-the-art CPU algorithm.},

  abstract  = {The capability of solving a geotechnical discrete element method (DEM) applications is determined by the complexity of the simulation and its computational requirements. Collision detection algorithms are fundamental to resolve the mechanical collisions between millions of particles efficiently. These algorithms are a bottleneck for many DEM applications resulting in excessive memory usage or poor computational performance. In particular, for GPU based DEM, there are many factors for a user to consider when deciding on an algorithm. This study discusses a set of diverse classes of geotechnical problems and the impact of algorithm choice. Four factors were considered: i) the world domain size, number of particles and particle density, ii) polydispersity in size, iii) the time evolution and iv) the particle shape. This study shows that for spherical particles, the choice of broad-phase collision detection algorithm has the most impact on computational performance. The computational cost for convex polyhedral particles is dominated by the selection of the particles' bounding volumes and their intersection tests over the selection of the broad-phase collision detection algorithm. On average for convex polyhedral particles, the broad-phase occupies at most 1.3\% of the total runtime, while the narrow-phase collision detection and collision response require more than 87\% of the runtime. A combination of bounding spheres and axis-aligned bounding boxes for use as bounding volumes of particles showed the best performance reducing the computational cost by 20\%. This study serves as a guide for further research in the field of GPU based DEM collision detection and the application in geotechnics.},

There are a number of exact, deterministic algorithms for this purpose, whose complexities are high in practice. There are randomized approaches for special classes of bipartite graphs. Random 2-out bipartite graphs, where each vertex chooses two neighbors at random from the other side, form one class for which there is an $O(m + n log n)$-time Monte Carlo algorithm. Regular bipartite graphs, where all vertices have the same degree, form another class for which there is an expected $O(m + n log n)$-time Las Vegas algorithm. We investigate these two algorithms and turn them into practical heuristics with randomization. Experimental results show that the heuristics are fast and obtain near optimal matchings. They are also more robust than the state of the art heuristics used in the cardinality matching algorithms, and are generally more useful as initialization routines.}

The most computationally demanding aspect of such an approach is the computation of the search direction during each iteration, for which we consider the use of matrix-free methods. In particular, we develop a method that requires an inexact solve of a single QP subproblem to establish the convergence of the overall SQP method. It is known that SQP methods can be plagued by poor behavior of the global convergence mechanism. To confront this issue, we propose the use of an exact penalty function with a dynamic penalty parameter updating strategy to be employed within the subproblem solver in such a way that the resulting search direction predicts progress toward both feasibility and optimality. We present our parameter updating strategy and prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the strategy does not modify the penalty parameter unnecessarily. We close the paper with a discussion of the results of numerical experiments that illustrate the benefits of our proposed techniques.},

Furthermore, its low computational requirement allows it to make rapid progress when optimizing high-dimensional functions. Its performance is examined on a set of test problems of moderate to high dimension and a high-dimensional design optimization problem.

  abstract  = {Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) applications often rely on performing many small matrix operations -- in particular general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM). These operations are usually performed in a reduced precision, such as the 16-bit floating-point format (i.e., half precision or FP16). The GEMM operation is also very important for dense linear algebra algorithms, and half-precision GEMM operations can be used in mixed-precision linear solvers. Therefore, high-performance batched GEMM operations in reduced precision are significantly important, not only for deep learning frameworks, but also for scientific applications that rely on batched linear algebra, such as tensor contractions and sparse direct solvers.\\ This paper presents optimized batched GEMM kernels for graphics processing units (GPUs) in FP16 arithmetic. The paper addresses both real and complex half-precision computations on the GPU. The proposed design takes advantage of the Tensor Core technology that was recently introduced in CUDA-enabled GPUs. With eight tuning parameters introduced in the design, the developed kernels have a high degree of flexibility that overcomes the limitations imposed by the hardware and software (in the form of discrete configurations for the Tensor Core APIs). For real FP16 arithmetic, performance speedups are observed against cuBLAS for sizes up to 128, and range between $1.5\times$ and $2.5\times$. For the complex FP16 GEMM kernel, the speedups are between $1.7\times$ and $7\times$ thanks to a design that uses the standard interleaved matrix layout, in contrast with the planar layout required by the vendor's solution. The paper also discusses special optimizations for extremely small matrices, where even higher performance gains are achievable.},

While numerical reproducibility is desirable in HPC, it is often unachievable due to the different ways compilers treat floating-point arithmetic and generate code around it. This reproducibility problem is exacerbated in heterogeneous HPC systems where code can be executed on different floating-point hardware, e.g., a host and a device architecture, producing in some situations different numerical results. We present VARITY, a tool to quantify floatingpoint variations in heterogeneous HPC systems. Our approach generates random test programs for multiple architectures (host and device) using the compilers that are available in the system. Using differential testing, it compares floating-point results and identifies unexpected variations in the program results. The results can guide programmers in choosing the compilers that produce the most similar results in a system, which is useful when numerical reproducibility is critical. By running 50,000 experiments with Varity on a system with IBM POWER9 CPUs, NVIDIA V100 GPUs, and four compilers (gcc, clang, xl, and nvcc), we identify and document several programs that produce significantly different results for a given input when different compilers or architectures are used, even when a similar optimization level is used everywhere.},

  abstract    = {The convergence of several unprecedented changes, including formidable new system design constraints and revolutionary levels of heterogeneity, has made it clear that much of the essential software infrastructure of computational science and engineering is, or will soon be, obsolete. Math libraries have historically been in the vanguard of software that must be adapted first to such changes, both because these low-level workhorses are so critical to the accuracy and performance of so many different types of applications, and because they have proved to be outstanding vehicles for finding and implementing solutions to the problems that novel architectures pose. Under the Basic ALgebra LIbraries for Sustainable Technology with Interdisciplinary Collaboration (BALLISTIC) project, the principal designers of the Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) and the Scalable Linear Algebra PACKage (ScaLAPACK), the combination of which is abbreviated Sca/LAPACK, aim to enhance and update these libraries for the ongoing revolution in processor architecture, system design, and application requirements by incorporating them into a layered package of software components -- the BALLISTIC ecosystem -- that provides users seamless access to state-of-the-art solver implementations through familiar and improved Sca/LAPACK interfaces.\\ The set of innovations and improvements that will be made available through BALLISTIC is the result of a combination of inputs from a variety of sources: the authors' own algorithmic and software research, which attacks the challenges of multi-core, hybrid, and extreme-scale system designs; extensive interactions with users, vendors, and the management of large high-performance computing (HPC) facilities to help anticipate the demands and opportunities of new architectures and programming languages; and, finally, the enthusiastic participation of the research community in developing and offering enhanced versions of existing dense linear algebra software components. Aiming to help applications run portably at all levels of the platform pyramid, including in cloud-based systems, BALLISTIC's technical agenda includes: (1) adding new functionality requested by stakeholder communities; (2) incorporating vastly improved numerical methods and algorithms; (3) leveraging successful research results to transition Sca/LAPACK (interfaces) to multi-core and accelerator-enabled versions; (4) providing user-controllable autotuning for the deployed software; (5) introducing new interfaces and data structures to increase ease of use; (6) enhancing engineering for evolution via standards and community engagement; and (7) continuing to expand application community outreach. Enhanced engineering will also help keep the reference implementation for Sca/LAPACK efficient, maintainable, and testable at reasonable cost in the future.\\ The Sca/LAPACK libraries are the community standard for dense linear algebra. They have been adopted and/or supported by a large community of users, computing centers, and HPC vendors. Learning to use them is a basic part of the education of a computational scientist or engineer in many fields and at many academic institutions. No other numerical library can claim this breadth of integration with the community. Consequently, enhancing these libraries with state-of-the-art methods and algorithms and adapting them for new and emerging platforms (reaching up to extreme scale and including cloud-based environments) is set to have a correspondingly large impact on the research and education community, government laboratories, and private industry.}

  abstract  = {Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a powerful deep learning technique that has been widely used in many real-world data-mining applications such as language modeling and machine translation. In this paper, we aim to minimize the latency of LSTM inference on cloud systems without losing accuracy. If an LSTM model does not fit in cache, the latency due to data movement will likely be greater than that due to computation. In this case, we reduce model parameters. If, as in most applications we consider, the LSTM models are able to fit the cache of cloud server processors, we focus on reducing the number of floating point operations, which has a corresponding linear impact on the latency of the inference calculation. Thus, in our system, we dynamically reduce model parameters or flops depending on which most impacts latency. Our inference system is based on singular value decomposition and canonical polyadic decomposition. Our system is accurate and low latency. We evaluate our system based on models from a series of real-world applications like language modeling, computer vision, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Users of our system can use either pre-trained models or start from scratch. Our system achieves $15\times$ average speedup for six real-world applications without losing accuracy in inference. We also design and implement a distributed optimization system with dynamic decomposition, which can significantly reduce the energy cost and accelerate the training process.},

Generating inputs to maximize the numerical error is critical when evaluating the accuracy of floating-point code. In this paper, we formulate the problem of generating high error-inducing floating-point inputs as a code coverage maximization problem solved using symbolic execution. Specifically, we define inaccuracy checks to detect large precision loss and cancellation. We inject these checks at strategic program locations to construct specialized branches that, when covered by a given input, are likely to lead to large errors in the result. We apply symbolic execution to generate inputs that exercise these specialized branches, and describe optimizations that make our approach practical. We implement a tool named FPGen and present an evaluation on 21 numerical programs including matrix computation and statistics libraries. We show that FPGen exposes errors for 20 of these programs and triggers errors that are, on average, over 2 orders of magnitude larger than the state of the art.}

These constructions use explicit information within the integral terms, but treat boundary data implicitly, which contributes to the overall speed of the method. This approach is provably unconditionally stable for linear problems and stability has been demonstrated experimentally for nonlinear problems. Additionally, it is matrix-free in the sense that it is not necessary to invert linear systems and iteration is not required for nonlinear terms. Moreover, the scheme employs a fast summation algorithm that yields a method with a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where $N$ is the number of mesh points along a direction. While much work has been done to explore the theory behind these methods, their practicality in large scale computing environments is a largely unexplored topic. In this work, we explore the performance of these methods by developing a domain decomposition algorithm suitable for distributed memory systems along with shared memory algorithms. As a first pass, we derive an artificial CFL condition that enforces a nearest-neighbor communication pattern and briefly discuss possible generalizations. We also analyze several approaches for implementing the parallel algorithms by optimizing predominant loop structures and maximizing data reuse. Using a hybrid design that employs MPI and Kokkos for the distributed and shared memory components of the algorithms, respectively, we show that our methods are efficient and can sustain an update rate $> 1\times10^8$ DOF/node/s. We provide results that demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our algorithms using several different PDE test problems, including a nonlinear example, which employs an adaptive time-stepping rule.},

This paper reports our real experience and lessons learned from testing five simulation programs that will be used to design and analyze nuclear power plants. We applied five testing approaches and found 33 bugs. We found that property-based testing and metamorphic testing are two effective methods. Nevertheless, we suffered from the lack of domain knowledge, the high test costs, the shortage of test cases, severe oracle issues, and inadequate automation support. Consequently, the five programs are not exhaustively tested from the perspective of software testing, and many existing software testing techniques and tools are not fully applicable due to scalability and portability issues. We need more collaboration and communication with other communities to promote the research and application of software testing techniques.},

  abstract  = {Deep learning (DL) has become a key tool for solving complex scientific problems. However, managing the multi-dimensional large-scale data associated with DL, especially atop extant multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) in modern supercomputers poses significant challenges. Moreover, the latest high-performance computing (HPC) architectures bring different performance trends in training throughput compared to the existing studies. Existing DL optimizations such as larger batch size and GPU locality-aware scheduling have little effect on improving DL training throughput performance due to fast CPU-to-GPU connections. Additionally, DL training on multiple GPUs scales sublinearly. Thus, simply adding more GPUs to a system is ineffective. To this end, we design MARBLE, a first-of-its-kind job scheduler, which considers the non-linear scalability of GPUs at the intra-node level to schedule an appropriate number of GPUs per node for a job. By sharing the GPU resources on a node with multiple DL jobs, MARBLE avoids low GPU utilization in current multi-GPU DL training on HPC systems. Our comprehensive evaluation in the Summit supercomputer shows that MARBLE is able to improve DL training performance by up to 48.3\% compared to the popular Platform Load Sharing Facility (LSF) scheduler. Compared to the state-of-the-art of DL scheduler, Optimus, MARBLE reduces the job completion time by up to 47\%.},

  abstract    = {As computers reach exascale and beyond, the incidence of faults will increase. Solutions to this problem are an active research topic. We focus on strategies to make the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) solver resilient against node failures, specifically, the exact state reconstruction (ESR) method, which exploits redundancies in PCG. Reducing the frequency at which redundant information is stored lessens the runtime overhead. However, after the node failure, the solver must restart from the last iteration for which redundant information was stored, which increases recovery overhead. This formulation highlights the method's similarities to checkpoint-restart (CR). Thus, this method, which we call ESR with periodic storage (ESRP), can be considered a form of algorithm-based checkpoint-restart. The state is stored implicitly, by exploiting redundancy inherent to the algorithm, rather than explicitly as in CR. We also minimize the amount of data to be stored and retrieved compared to CR, but additional computation is required to reconstruct the solver's state. In this paper, we describe the necessary modifications to ESR to convert it into ESRP, and perform an experimental evaluation. We compare ESRP experimentally with previously-existing ESR and application-level in-memory CR. Our results confirm that the overhead for ESR is reduced significantly, both in the failure-free case, and if node failures are introduced. In the former case, the overhead of ESRP is usually lower than that of CR. However, CR is faster if node failures happen. We claim that these differences can be alleviated by the implementation of more appropriate preconditioners.},

For instance, threading computational environments gave scaling problems with a shared graph structure in memory. Also sparse matrix ordering techniques and multivector, or SIMD, optimizations were required to get a total runtime of a few days.

DLSFLN uses the inheritance of some functions to obtain various activation functions through continuous differentiation of functions. The types of activation functions were increased and the mapping capability of hidden layer neurons was enhanced when the random parameter dimension was maintained. DLSFLN randomly generates the input weights and hidden layer thresholds and uses the least square method to determine the connection weights between the output and the input layers and that between the output and the input nodes. The regression and classification experiments show that DLSFLN has a faster training speed and better training accuracy, generalization capability, and stability compared with other neural network algorithms, such as fast learning network(FLN).},

The UGA algorithm can output a $\frac{(1+\epsilon)^2}{(1-\epsilon)^2}$-spectral sparsifier with $\lceil\frac{n}{\epsilon^2}\rceil$ edges in $O(m+n^2/\epsilon^2)$ time with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices for a general random graph satisfying a mild sufficient condition. This is a linear time algorithm in terms of the number of edges that the community of graph sparsification is looking for. The best result in the literature to the knowledge of the authors is the existence of a deterministic algorithm which is almost linear, i.e. $O(m^{1+o(1)})$ for some $o(1)=O(\frac{(\log\log(m))^{2/3}}{\log^{1/3}(m)})$. We shall point out that several random graphs satisfy the sufficient condition and hence, can be sparsified in linear time. For a general spectral sparsification problem, e.g., positive subset selection problem, a nonnegative UGA algorithm is proposed which needs $O(mn^2+ n^3/\epsilon^2)$ time and the convergence is established.},

We mitigate these problems by implementing two new parallel approaches that handle block sparsity arising in DMRG, via Cyclops, a distributed memory tensor contraction library. We benchmark their performance on two physical systems using the Blue Waters and Stampede2 supercomputers. Our DMRG performance is improved by up to 5.9X in runtime and 99X in processing rate over ITensor, at roughly comparable computational resource use. This enables higher accuracy calculations via larger tensors for quantum state approximation. We demonstrate that despite having limited concurrency, DMRG is weakly scalable with the use of efficient parallel tensor contraction mechanisms.},

Many shared-memory applications are implemented using this model despite not being ideal for applications with high load imbalance, such as those that make irregular memory accesses. One parameter, i.e., chunk size, is made available to users in order to mitigate performance loss. However, this parameter is dependent on architecture, system load, application, and input; making it difficult to tune. We present an OpenMP scheduler that does an adaptive tuning for chunk size for unbalanced applications that make irregular memory accesses. In particular, this method(iCh) uses work-stealing for imbalance and adapts chunk size using a force-feedback model that approximates variance of task length in a chunk. This scheduler has low overhead and allows for active load balancing while the applications are running. We demonstrate this using both sparse matrix-vector multiplication (spmv) and Betweenness Centrality (bc) and show that iCh can achieve average speedups close (i.e., within 1.061x for spmv and 1.092x for bc) of either OpenMP loops scheduled with dynamic or work-stealing methods that had chunk size tuned offline.},

Recent advances in quantum annealing hardware open the possibility of empirical testing of QA against the most challenging computational problems arising in geospatial applications. This chapter demonstrates how to employ QA to solve NP-hard spatial optimization problems through an illustrative example of programming a p-median model and a case study on spatial supply chain optimization.

Numerical experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is accurate, and computationally efficient with comparable or better performance than available CMTF methods for Frobenius norm loss, while being more flexible. Using Kullback-Leibler divergence on count data, we demonstrate that the algorithm yields accurate results also for other loss functions.},

Furthermore, the whole computation may need to be repeated if the underlying graph changes some low percentage of edge updates. We present a method inspired by spectral clustering where we instead use matrix sketches derived from random dimension-reducing projections. We show that our method produces embeddings that yield performant clustering results given a fully-dynamic stochastic block model stream using both the fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss and CountSketch transforms.

We define two types of entropies on flows to quantify mixing and develop numerical algorithms to optimize the combination of entropy and energy on networks, given constraints on the amount of available material. We present an in-depth exploration of optimal single source-sink networks on finite triangular grids, a fundamental setting for optimal transport networks in the plane. Using numerical simulations and rigorous proofs, we show that, if the constraint on conductances is strict, the optimal networks are paths of every possible length. If the constraint is relaxed, our algorithm produces loopy networks that fan out at the source and pour back into a single path that flows to the sink. Taken together, our results expand the class of optimal transportation networks that can be compared with real biological data, and highlight how real network morphologies may be shaped by tradeoffs between transport efficiency and the need to mix the transported matter.},

These graphs can be enormously large and thus, scalable graph analysis has been the subject of many research efforts. To enable scalable analytics, many researchers have focused on generating realistic graphs that support controlled experiments for understanding how algorithms perform under changing graph features. Significant progress has been made on scalable graph generation which preserve some important graph properties (e.g., degree distribution, clustering coefficients). In this paper, we study how to sample a graph from the space of graphs with a given shell distribution. Shell distribution is related to the $k$-core, which is the largest subgraph where each vertex is connected to at least $k$other vertices. A $k$-shell is the subset of vertices that are in $k$-core but not $( k +1)$-core, and the shell distribution comprises the sizes of these shells. Core decompositions are widely used to extract information from graphs and to assist other computations. We present a scalable shared and distributed memory graph generator that, given a shell decomposition, generates a random graph that conforms to it. Our extensive experimental results show the efficiency and scalability of our methods. Our algorithm generates $2 ^{33}$ vertices and $2 ^{37}$ edges in less than 50 seconds on 384 cores.},

  abstract  = {The ESSEX project has investigated programming concepts, data structures, and numerical algorithms for scalable, efficient, and robust sparse eigenvalue solvers on future heterogeneous exascale systems. Starting without the burden of legacy code, a holistic performance engineering process could be deployed across the traditional software layers to identify efficient implementations and guide sustainable software development. At the basic building blocks level, a flexible MPI+X programming approach was implemented together with a new sparse data structure (SELL-C-$\sigma$) to support heterogeneous architectures by design. Furthermore, ESSEX focused on hardware-efficient kernels for all relevant architectures and efficient data structures for block vector formulations of the eigensolvers. The algorithm layer addressed standard, generalized, and nonlinear eigenvalue problems and provided some widely usable solver implementations including a block Jacobi--Davidson algorithm, contour-based integration schemes, and filter polynomial approaches. Adding to the highly efficient kernel implementations, algorithmic advances such as adaptive precision, optimized filtering coefficients, and preconditioning have further improved time to solution. These developments were guided by quantum physics applications, especially from the field of topological insulator- or graphene-based systems. For these, ScaMaC, a scalable matrix generation framework for a broad set of quantum physics problems, was developed. As the central software core of ESSEX, the PHIST library for sparse systems of linear equations and eigenvalue problems has been established. It abstracts algorithmic developments from low-level optimization. Finally, central ESSEX software components and solvers have demonstrated scalability and hardware efficiency on up to 256 K cores using million-way process/thread-level parallelism.},

ALM is highly flexible with respect to how primal subproblems can be solved, giving rise to a plethora of different primal-dual methods. The powerful ALM mechanism has recently proved to be very successful in various large-scale and distributed applications. In addition, several significant advances have appeared, primarily on precise complexity results with respect to computational and communication costs in the presence of inexact updates and design and analysis of novel optimal methods for distributed consensus optimization. We provide a tutorial-style introduction to ALM and its variants for solving convex optimization problems in large-scale and distributed settings. We describe control-theoretic tools for the algorithms' analysis and design, survey recent results, and provide novel insights into the context of two emerging applications: federated learning and distributed energy trading.},

These methods converge rapidly near a solution but may not be reliable from arbitrary starting points. The well known example MINOS has proven effective on many large problems. Its success motivates us to propose a globally convergent variant. Our stabilized LCL method possesses two important properties: the subproblems are always feasible, and they may be solved inexactly. These features are present in MINOS only as heuristics.\\ The new algorithm has been implemented in Matlab, with the option to use either the MINOS or SNOPT Fortran codes to solve the linearly constrained subproblems. Only first derivatives are required. We present numerical results on a nonlinear subset of the COPS, CUTE, and HS testproblem sets, which include many large examples. The results demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the stabilized LCL procedure.}

Our parallel schemes can distribute the computation and storage overhead among multiple GPUs and enable us to perform almost interactive simulation on complex cloth meshes, which can hardly be handled on a single GPU due to memory limitations. We have evaluated the performance with two multi-GPU workstations (with 4 and 8 GPUs, respectively) on cloth meshes with 0.5-1.65M triangles. Our approach can reliably handle the collisions and generate vivid wrinkles and folds at 2-5 fps, which is significantly faster than prior cloth simulation systems.

We consider contiguous partitions, where the rows (or columns) of the matrix are split into $K$ parts without reordering. We present exact and approximate contiguous partitioning algorithms that minimize the runtime of the longest-running processor under cost models that combine work factors and hypergraph communication factors. This differs from traditional graph or hypergraph partitioning models which minimize total communication under a work balance constraint. We address regimes where partitions of the row space and column space are expected to match (the symmetric case) or are allowed to differ (the nonsymmetric case). Our algorithms use linear space. Our exact algorithm runs in linear time when $K^2$ is sublinear. Our $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate algorithm runs in linear time when $K\log(1/\epsilon)$ is sublinear. We combine concepts from high-performance computing and computational geometry. Existing load balancing algorithms optimize a linear model of per-processor work. We make minor adaptations to optimize arbitrary nonuniform monotonic increasing or decreasing cost functions which may be expensive to evaluate. We then show that evaluating our model of communication is equivalent to planar dominance counting. We specialize Chazelle's dominance counting algorithm to points in the bounded integer plane and generalize it to trade reduced construction time for increased query time, since our partitioners make very few queries. Our algorithms split the original row (or column) ordering into parts to optimize diverse cost models. Combined with reordering or embedding techniques, our algorithms might be used to build more general heuristic partitioners, as they can optimally round one-dimensional embeddings of direct $K$-way noncontiguous partitioning problems.},

This problem differs from the maximum weight matching problem, for which scalable approximation algorithms are known. It is primarily motivated by finding good pivots in scalable sparse direct solvers before factorization. Due to the lack of scalable alternatives, distributed solvers use sequential implementations of maximum weight perfect matching algorithms, such as those available in MC64. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully parallel distributed memory algorithm that first generates a perfect matching and then iteratively improves the weight of the perfect matching by searching for weight-increasing cycles of length 4 in parallel. For most practical problems the weights of the perfect matchings generated by our algorithm are very close to the optimum. An efficient implementation of the algorithm scales up to 256 nodes (17,408 cores) on a Cray XC40 supercomputer and can solve instances that are too large to be handled by a single node using the sequential algorithm.},

We investigate, through both fault injection campaigns and accelerated neutron beam experiments, the impact of RPDWC onto performance, energy consumption, and its fault detection capabilites. We show that RP-DWC achieves on average 74\% fault coverage (up to 86\%) with very small overheads (0.1\% time and 24\% energy consumption overhead, in the best case).},

This work introduces *Smith, a language-agnostic framework for the generation of valid, compilable test programs. It takes as input an abstract attribute grammar that specifies the syntactic and semantic rules of a programming language. It then creates test programs that satisfy all these rules. By aggressively pruning the search space and keeping the construction as local as possible, *Smith can generate huge, complex test programs in short time. We present four case studies covering four real-world programming languages (C, Lua, SQL, and SMT-LIB 2) to show that *Smith is both efficient and effective, while being flexible enough to support programming languages that differ considerably. We found bugs in all four case studies. For example, *Smith detected 165 different crashes in older versions of GCC and LLVM. *Smith and the language grammars are available online.},

Under Lipschitz assumptions on the Riemannian gradient and Hessian of the cost function, these methods find approximate first-order critical points strictly faster than regular gradient descent. A randomized version also finds approximate second-order critical points. Both the algorithms and their analyses build extensively on existing work in the Euclidean case. The basic operation consists in running the Euclidean accelerated gradient descent method (appropriately safe-guarded against non-convexity) in the current tangent space, then moving back to the manifold and repeating. This requires lifting the cost function from the manifold to the tangent space, which can be done for example through the Riemannian exponential map. For this approach to succeed, the lifted cost function (called the pullback) must retain certain Lipschitz properties. As a contribution of independent interest, we prove precise claims to that effect, with explicit constants. Those claims are affected by the Riemannian curvature of the manifold, which in turn affects the worst-case complexity bounds for our optimization algorithms.},

Since the setup phase of the selection AMG, i.e. sorting the equations into coarse and fine subsets is inherently sequential, it was decided to perform the setup phase locally on each processing unit. The prolongation matrix for transferring the correction from coarse to fine level and restriction matrix for transferring the residual from fine to coarse level are assembled locally as well. Parallel communication is necessary only for the calculation of the coarse level matrix, i.e. the matrix elements which describe the cross--coupling of equations located on different processing units. A localised version of the ILU factorisation based on Crout's algorithm is used as a smoother in the multigrid cycle. A detailed analysis of the coarse level matrix complexity is conducted in the context of the finite volume method in domain decomposition mode.

These developments, along with existing HPC AI software capabilities, have been integrated into MagmaDNN, an open-source HPC deep learning framework. Many deep learning frameworks are targeted at data scientists and fall short in providing quality integration into existing HPC workflows. This paper discusses the necessities of an HPC deep learning framework and how those needs can be provided (e.g., as in MagmaDNN) through a deep integration with existing HPC libraries, such as MAGMA and its modular memory management, MPI, CuBLAS, CuDNN, MKL, and HIP. Advancements are also illustrated through the use of algorithmic enhancements in reduced- and mixed-precision, as well as asynchronous optimization methods. Finally, we present illustrations and potential solutions for enhancing traditional compute- and data-intensive applications at ORNL and UTK with AI. The approaches and future challenges are illustrated in materials science, imaging, and climate applications.}

  abstract  = {The sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) kernel is an important building block for a number of linear algebra routines such as sparse direct and iterative solvers. The major challenge of accelerating SpTRSV lies in the difficulties of finding higher parallelism. Existing work mainly focuses on reducing dependencies and synchronizations in the level-set methods. However, the 2D block layout of the input matrix has been largely ignored in designing more efficient SpTRSV algorithms.\\ In this paper, we implement three block algorithms, i.e., column block, row block and recursive block algorithms, for parallel SpTRSV on modern GPUs, and propose an adaptive approach that can automatically select the best kernels according to input sparsity structures. By testing 159 sparse matrices on two high-end NVIDIA GPUs, the experimental results demonstrate that the recursive block algorithm has the best performance among the three block algorithms, and it is on average 4.72$\times$ (up to 72.03$\times$) and 9.95$\times$ (up to 61.08$\times$) faster than cuSPARSE v2 and Sync-free methods, respectively. Besides, our method merely needs moderate cost for preprocessing the input matrix, thus is highly efficient for multiple right-hand sides and iterative scenarios.},

  abstract  = {Sparse triangular solves (SpTRSVs) have been extensively used in linear algebra fields, and many GPU-based SpTRSV algorithms have been proposed. Synchronization-free SpTRSVs, due to their short preprocessing time and high performance, are currently the most popular SpTRSV algorithms. However, we observe that the performance of those SpTRSV algorithms on different matrices can vary greatly by 845 times. Our further studies show that when the average number of components per level is high and the average number of nonzero elements per row is low, those SpTRSVs exhibit extremely low performance. The reason is that, they use a warp on the GPU to process a row in sparse matrices, and such warp-level designs have severe underutilization of the GPU. To solve this problem, we propose CapelliniSpTRSV, a thread-level synchronization-free SpTRSV algorithm. Particularly, CapelliniSpTRSV has three novel features. First, unlike the previous studies, CapelliniSpTRSV does not need preprocessing to calculate levels. Second, CapelliniSpTRSV exhibits high performance on matrices that previous SpTRSVs cannot handle efficiently. Third, CapelliniSpTRSV's optimization does not rely on specific sparse matrix storage format. Instead, it can achieve very good performance on the most popular sparse matrix storage, compressed sparse row (CSR) format, and thus users do not need to conduct format conversion. We evaluate CapelliniSpTRSV with 245 matrices from the Florida Sparse Matrix Collection on three GPU platforms, and experiments show that our SpTRSV exhibits 6.84 GFLOPS/s, which is 4.97$\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art synchronization-free SpTRSV algorithm, and 4.74$\times$ speedup over the SpTRSV in cuSPARSE.

Even a single node can contain multiple co-processors such as GPUs and multiple CPU cores. For example, ORNL's Summit accumulates six NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs and 42 IBM Power9 cores on each node. Synchronizing across compute resources of multiple nodes can be prohibitively expensive. Hence, it is necessary to develop and study asynchronous algorithms that circumvent this issue of bulk-synchronous computing. In this study, we examine the asynchronous version of the abstract Restricted Additive Schwarz method as a solver. We do not explicitly synchronize, but allow the communication between the sub-domains to be completely asynchronous, thereby removing the bulk synchronous nature of the algorithm.\\ We accomplish this by using the one-sided Remote Memory Access (RMA) functions of the MPI standard. We study the benefits of using such an asynchronous solver over its synchronous counterpart. We also study the communication patterns governed by the partitioning and the overlap between the sub-domains on the global solver. Finally, we show that this concept can render attractive performance benefits over the synchronous counterparts even for a well-balanced problem.},

  abstract  = {Generating polyhedral outer approximations and solving mixed-integer linear relaxations remains one of the main approaches for solving convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. There are several algorithms based on this concept, and the efficiency is greatly affected by the tightness of the outer approximation. In this paper, we present a new framework for strengthening cutting planes of nonlinear convex constraints, to obtain tighter outer approximations. The strengthened cuts can give a tighter continuous relaxation and an overall tighter representation of the nonlinear constraints. The cuts are strengthened by analyzing disjunctive structures in the MINLP problem, and we present two types of strengthened cuts. The first type of cut is obtained by reducing the right-hand side value of the original cut, such that it forms the tightest generally valid inequality for a chosen disjunction. The second type of cut effectively uses individual right-hand side values for each term of the disjunction. We prove that both types of cuts are valid and that the second type of cut can dominate both the first type and the original cut. We use the cut strengthening in conjunction with the extended supporting hyperplane algorithm, and numerical results show that the strengthening can significantly reduce both the number of iterations and the time needed to solve convex MINLP problems.},

In this paper, we bridge the gap between relaxation methods based on regular splittings and preconditioners by demonstrating that iterative refinement can be leveraged to construct a relaxation method from the preconditioner.

One of the pre-processing stages of sparse direct solvers consists of mapping computational resources (processors) to these tasks. The objective is to minimize the factorization time by exhibiting good data locality and load balancing. The proportional mapping technique is a widely used approach to solve this resource-allocation problem. It achieves good data locality by assigning the same processors to large parts of the elimination tree. However, it may limit load balancing in some cases. In this paper, we propose a dynamic mapping algorithm based on proportional mapping. This new approach, named Steal, relaxes the data locality criterion to improve load balancing. In order to validate the newly introduced method, we perform extensive experiments on the PaStiX sparse direct solver. It demonstrates that our algorithm enables better static scheduling of the numerical factorization while keeping good data locality.},

The parallel implementation of SpTRSV is a challenging task due to the sequential nature of the steps involved. This makes it, in many cases, one of the most time-consuming operations in an application. Many approaches for efficient SpTRSV on CPU and GPU systems have been proposed in the literature. However, no single implementation or platform (CPU or GPU) gives the fastest solution for all input sparse matrices. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based framework to predict the SpTRSV implementation giving the fastest execution time for a given sparse matrix based on its structural features. The framework is tested with six SpTRSV implementations on a state-of-the-art CPU-GPU machine (Intel Xeon Gold CPU, NVIDIA V100 GPU). Experimental results, with 998 matrices taken from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, show the classifier prediction accuracy of 87\% for the fastest SpTRSV algorithm for a given input matrix. Predicted SpTRSV implementations achieve average speedups (harmonic mean) in the range of 1.4--2.7$\times$ against the six SpTRSV implementations used in the evaluation.},

This work, for the first time, introduces a solver-free approach (SF-GRASS) for spectral graph sparsification by leveraging emerging spectral graph coarsening and graph signal processing (GSP) techniques. We introduce a local spectral embedding scheme for efficiently identifying spectrally-critical edges that are key to preserving graph spectral properties, such as the first few Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since the key kernel functions in SF-GRASS can be efficiently implemented using sparse-matrix-vector-multiplications (SpMVs), the proposed spectral approach is simple to implement and inherently parallel friendly. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can produce a hierarchy of high-quality spectral sparsifiers in nearly-linear time for a variety of real-world, large-scale graphs and circuit networks when compared with the prior state-of-the-art spectral method.},

Our results characterize the complexity of these two questions for all degrees left open by prior literature. Our main contributions reveal that many of these questions turn out to be tractable for cubic polynomials. In particular, we present an efficiently-checkable necessary and sufficient condition for local minimality of a point for a cubic polynomial. We also show that a local minimum of a cubic polynomial can be efficiently found by solving semidefinite programs of size linear in the number of variables. By contrast, we show that it is strongly NP-hard to decide if a cubic polynomial has a critical point. We also prove that the set of second-order points of any cubic polynomial is a spectrahedron, and conversely that any spectrahedron is the projection of the set of second-order points of a cubic polynomial.

Success of any null-space approach is dependent on the construction of a suitable null-space basis. The not uncommon case of the off-diagonal block being a wide matrix that has far fewer rows than columns and that may be dense is considered. A number of approaches are explored with the aim of balancing stability of the transformed system with sparsity.

With the increase of the volume of data and the size and complexity of the statistical models used to formulate these often ill-conditioned optimization tasks, there is a need for new efficient algorithms able to cope with these challenges. In this thesis, we deal with each of these sources of difficulty in a different way. To efficiently address the big data issue, we develop new methods which in each iteration examine a small random subset of the training data only. To handle the big model issue, we develop methods which in each iteration update a random subset of the model parameters only. Finally, to deal with ill-conditioned problems, we devise methods that incorporate either higher-order information or Nesterov's acceleration/momentum. In all cases, randomness is viewed as a powerful algorithmic tool that we tune, both in theory and in experiments, to achieve the best results. Our algorithms have their primary application in training supervised machine learning models via regularized empirical risk minimization, which is the dominant paradigm for training such models. However, due to their generality, our methods can be applied in many other fields, including but not limited to data science, engineering, scientific computing, and statistics.},

  abstract = {In this work, we deal with Truncated Newton methods for solving large scale (possibly nonconvex) unconstrained optimization problems. In particular, we consider the use of a modified Bunch and Kaufman factorization for solving the Newton equation, at each (outer) iteration of the method. The Bunch and Kaufman factorization of a tridiagonal matrix is an effective and stable matrix decomposition, which is well exploited in the widely adopted SYMMBK [2, 5, 6, 19, 20] routine. It can be used to provide conjugate directions, both in the case of $1 \times 1$ and $2 \times 2$ pivoting steps. The main drawback is that the resulting solution of Newton's equation might not be gradient--related, in the case the objective function is nonconvex. Here we first focus on some theoretical properties, in order to ensure that at each iteration of the Truncated Newton method, the search direction obtained by using an adapted Bunch and Kaufman factorization is gradient--related. This allows to perform a standard Armijo-type linesearch procedure, using a bounded descent direction. Furthermore, the results of an extended numerical experience using large scale CUTEst problems is reported, showing the reliability and the efficiency of the proposed approach, both on convex and nonconvex problems.}

Usually these applications arise on data that has far more rows than columns, so-called "tall/skinny" matrices. In the big data analytics context, this may take the form of hundreds of millions to billions of rows with only a few hundred columns. There is a need, therefore, for fast, accurate, and scalable tall/skinny SVD implementations which can fully utilize modern computing resources. To that end, we present a survey of three different algorithms for computing the SVD for these kinds of tall/skinny data layouts using MPI for communication. We contextualize these with common big data analytics techniques, principally PCA. Finally, we present both CPU and GPU timing results from the Summit supercomputer, and discuss possible alternative approaches.},

Its use of distributed-memory parallelism enables it to efficiently decompose tensors that are too large for a single compute node's memory. GentenMPl leverages Sandia's decades-long investment in the Trilinos solver framework for much of its parallel-computation capability. Trilinos contains numerical algorithms and linear algebra classes that have been optimized for parallel simulation of complex physical phenomena. This work applies these tools to the data science problem of sparse tensor decomposition. In this report, we describe the use of Trilinos in GentenMPl, extensions needed for sparse tensor decomposition, and implementations of the CP-ALS (CP via alternating least squares [4, 7]) and GCP-SGD (generalized CP via stochastic gradient descent [11, 12, 17]) sparse tensor decomposition algorithms. We show that GentenMPl can decompose sparse tensors of extreme size, e.g., a 12.6-terabyte tensor on 8192 computer cores. We demonstrate that the Trilinos backbone provides good strong and weak scaling of the tensor decomposition algorithms.}

  abstract   = {The Schur--Parlett algorithm, implemented in MATLAB as $funm$, computes a function $f(A)$ of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ by using the Schur decomposition and a block recurrence of Parlett. The algorithm requires the ability to compute $f$ and its derivatives, and it requires that $f$ has a Taylor series expansion with a suitably large radius of convergence. We develop a version of the Schur--Parlett algorithm that requires only function values and uses higher precision arithmetic to evaluate $f$ on the diagonal blocks of order greater than $2$ (if there are any) of the reordered and blocked Schur form. The key idea is to compute by diagonalization the function of a small random diagonal perturbation of each triangular block, where the perturbation ensures that diagonalization will succeed. This multiprecision Schur--Parlett algorithm is applicable to arbitrary functions $f$ and, like the original Schur--Parlett algorithm, it generally behaves in a numerically stable fashion. Our algorithm is inspired by Davies's randomized approximate diagonalization method, but we explain why that is not a reliable numerical method for computing matrix functions. We apply our algorithm to the matrix Mittag--Leffler function and show that it yields results of accuracy similar to, and in some cases much greater than, the state of the art algorithm for this function. The algorithm will be useful for evaluating any matrix function for which the derivatives of the underlying function are not readily available or accurately computable.}

Early outlining of parallel regions and invocation of parallel code via OpenMP runtime functions are two of the most profound differences. Understanding the interplay between compiler optimizations, OpenMP compilation, and application performance is hard and usually requires specialized benchmarks and compilation analysis tools.\\
To this end, we present FAROS, an extensible framework to automate and structure the analysis of compiler optimization of OpenMP programs. FAROS provides a generic configuration interface to profile and analyze OpenMP applications with their native build configurations. Using FAROS on a set of 39 OpenMP programs, including HPC applications and kernels, we show that OpenMP compilation hinders optimization for the majority of programs. Comparing single-threaded OpenMP execution to its sequential counterpart, we observed slowdowns as much as 135.23\%. In some cases, however, OpenMP compilation speeds up execution as much as 25.48\% when OpenMP semantics help compiler optimization. Following analysis on compiler optimization reports enables us to pinpoint the reasons without in-depth knowledge of the compiler. The information can be used to improve compilers and also to bring performance on par through manual code refactoring.},

An important aspect of these methods is how to preserve relative distances between points in the higher-dimensional space after reducing rows and columns to fit in a lower dimensional space. This aspect is important because conclusions based on faulty visual reasoning can be harmful. Judging dissimilar points as similar or similar points as dissimilar on the basis of a visualization can lead to false conclusions. To ameliorate this bias and to make visualizations of very large datasets feasible, we introduce a new algorithm that selects a subset of rows and columns of a rectangular matrix. This selection is designed to preserve relative distances as closely as possible. We compare our matrix sketch to more traditional alternatives on a variety of artificial and real datasets.},

This paper describes an efficient approach in which the software stack provided by PETSc/TAO can be used for large-scale nonlinear time-dependent problems. While time integration can involve a range of high-order methods, both implicit and explicit. The PDE-constrained optimization algorithm used is gradient-based and seamlessly integrated with the simulation of the physical problem.},

  abstract  = {For highly nonlinear problems, the objective function f(x) may have multiple local optima and it is desired to locate all of them. Analytical or adjoint-based derivatives may not be available for most real optimization problems, especially, when responses of a system are predicted by numerical simulations. The distributed-Gauss-Newton (DGN) optimization method performs quite efficiently and robustly for history-matching problems with multiple best matches. However, this method is not applicable for generic optimization problems, e.g., life-cycle production optimization or well location optimization.\\
In this paper, we generalized the distribution techniques of the DGN optimization method and developed a new distributed quasi-Newton (DQN) optimization method that is applicable to generic optimization problems. It can handle generalized objective functions $F(x,y(x))=f(x)$ with both explicit variables x and implicit variables, i.e., simulated responses, $y(x)$. The partial derivatives of $F(x,y)$ with respect to both x and y can be computed analytically, whereas the partial derivatives of $y(x)$ with respect to x (sensitivity matrix) is estimated by applying the same efficient information sharing mechanism implemented in the DGN optimization method. An ensemble of quasi-Newton optimization tasks is distributed among multiple high-performance-computing (HPC) cluster nodes. The simulation results generated from one optimization task are shared with others by updating a common set of training data points, which records simulated responses of all simulation jobs. The sensitivity matrix at the current best solution of each optimization task is approximated by either the linear-interpolation (LI) method or the support-vector-regression (SVR) method, using some or all training data points. The gradient of the objective function is then analytically computed using its partial derivatives with respect to x and y and the estimated sensitivities of y with respect to $x$. The Hessian is updated using the quasi-Newton formulation. A new search point for each distributed optimization task is generated by solving a quasi-Newton trust-region subproblem for the next iteration.\\
The proposed DQN method is first validated on a synthetic history matching problem and its performance is found to be comparable with the DGN optimizer. Then, the DQN method is tested on different optimization problems. For all test problems, the DQN method can find multiple optima of the objective function with reasonably small numbers of iterations (30 to 50). Compared to sequential model-based derivative-free optimization methods, the DQN method can reduce the computational cost, in terms of the number of simulations required for convergence, by a factor of 3 to 10.}

In this article, we discuss decentralized first-order gradient methods, which have found tremendous success in control, signal processing, and machine learning problems, where such methods, due to their simplicity, serve as the first method of choice for many complex inference and training tasks. In particular, we provide a general framework of decentralized first-order methods that is applicable to undirected and directed communication networks alike, and show that much of the existing work on optimization and consensus can be related explicitly to this framework. We further extend the discussion to decentralized stochastic first-order methods that rely on stochastic gradients at each node and describe how local variance reduction schemes, previously shown to have promise in the centralized settings, are able to improve the performance of decentralized methods when combined with what is known as gradient tracking. We motivate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the corresponding methods in the context of machine learning and signal processing problems that arise in decentralized environments.},

  abstract  = {Clustering techniques are powerful tools commonly used in statistical learning and data analytics. Most of the past research formulates clustering tasks as a non-convex problem, where a global optimum often cannot be found. Recent studies show that hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering can be relaxed and analyzed as a convex problem. Moreover, sparse convex clustering algorithms are proposed to extend the convex clustering framework to high-dimensional space by introducing an adaptive group-Lasso penalty term. Due to the non-smoothness nature of the associated objective functions, there are still no efficient fast-convergent algorithms for clustering problems even with convexity. In this paper, we first review the structure of convex clustering problems and prove the differentiability of their dual problems. We then show that such reformulated dual problems can be efficiently solved by the accelerated first-order methods with the feasibility projection. Furthermore, we present a general framework for convex clustering with regularization terms and discuss a specific implementation of this framework using $L_{1,1}$-norm. We also derive the dual form for the regularized convex clustering problems and show that it can be efficiently solved by embedding a projection operator and a proximal operator in the accelerated gradient method. Finally, we compare our approach with several other co-clustering algorithms using a number of example clustering problems. Numerical results show that our models and solution methods outperform all the compared algorithms for both convex clustering and convex co-clustering.},

We discuss the need for an objective performance metric for graph operations and the desired characteristics of such a metric such that it more accurately captures the interactions between the amount of work performed and the capabilities of the hardware on which the code is executed. Using exact triangle counting as an example, we derive a metric that captures how certain techniques employed in many implementations improve performance.

By symmetric, we mean the rows and columns of the matrix are identically partitioned yielding a tiling where the diagonal tiles (blocks) will be squares. We first show that the optimal solution to this problem is NP-hard, and we propose four heuristics to solve two different variants of this problem. We present a thorough analysis of the computational complexities of those proposed heuristics. To make the proposed techniques more applicable in real life application scenarios, we further reduce their computational complexities by utilizing effective sparsification strategies together with an efficient sparse prefix-sum data structure. We experimentally show the proposed algorithms are efficient and effective on more than six hundred test matrices.

  abstract    = {The BFS algorithm is a basic graph data processing algorithm and many other graph data processing algorithms have similar architectural features with BFS algorithm and can be built on the basis of BFS algorithm model. We analyze the differences between graph algorithms and traditional high-performance algorithms in detail, propose a new way of classifying algorithms into data independent algorithm and data correlation algorithm based on their run-time correlation with data, and use this new classification to explain the validity of the methods proposed in this paper. Through a deeper analysis of graph data, we propose a new fundamental perspective on understanding graph data, establishing a link between two basic data structures, graph and tree, and viewing graph data as consisting of smaller subgraphs and edge trees. Small degree vertices are found to be one of important cause of random memory access. Based on this, we propose a general, easy to implement, and efficient method for graph data processing, with the basic idea of treating low-degree vertices and core subgraphs separately, thus significantly reducing the size of random memory access and improving the efficiency of memory access. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the method on three major data center computing platforms (Intel, AMD, and ARM), and the experiments showed that it brought 19.7\%, 31.8\% and 17.9\% performance improvement, respectively, with a performance-power ratio of 282.70 MTEPS/s on the ARM platform, ranking it among the Green graph500 in November 2019.

  abstract    = {Fast domain propagation of linear constraints has become a crucial component of today's best algorithms and solvers for mixed integer programming and pseudo-boolean optimization to achieve peak solving performance. Irregularities in the form of dynamic algorithmic behaviour, dependency structures, and sparsity patterns in the input data make efficient implementations of domain propagation on GPUs and, more generally, on parallel architectures challenging. This is one of the main reasons why domain propagation in state-of-the-art solvers is single thread only. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for domain propagation which (a) avoids these problems and allows for an efficient implementation on GPUs, and is (b) capable of running propagation rounds entirely on the GPU, without any need for synchronization or communication with the CPU. We present extensive computational results which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that ample speedups are possible on practically relevant problems: on state-of-the-art GPUs, our geometric mean speed-up for reasonably-large instances is around 10x to 20x and can be as high as 195x on favorably-large instances.},

We present a general framework of Contracting-Point methods, which solve at each iteration an auxiliary subproblem restricting the smooth part of the objective function onto contraction of the initial domain. This framework provides us with a systematic way for developing optimization methods of different order, endowed with the global complexity bounds. We show that using an appropriate affine-invariant smoothness condition, it is possible to implement one iteration of the Contracting-Point method by one step of the pure tensor method of degree $p \geq 1$. The resulting global rate of convergence in functional residual is then ${\cal O}(1 / k^p)$, where $k$ is the iteration counter. It is important that all constants in our bounds are affine-invariant. For $p = 1$, our scheme recovers well-known Frank-Wolfe algorithm, providing it with a new interpretation by a general perspective of tensor methods. Finally, within our framework, we present efficient implementation and total complexity analysis of the inexact second-order scheme $(p = 2)$, called Contracting Newton method. It can be seen as a proper implementation of the trust-region idea. Preliminary numerical results confirm its good practical performance both in the number of iterations, and in computational time.},

Much less is known about the efficiency of mixed precision parallel algorithms for sparse linear systems, and existing work focuses on single core experiments. We evaluate the benefits of using single precision arithmetic in solving a double precision sparse linear systems using multiple cores, focusing on the key components of LU factorization and matrix–vector products. We find that single precision sparse LU factorization is prone to a severe loss of performance due to the intrusion of subnormal numbers. We identify a mechanism that allows cascading fill-ins to generate subnormal numbers and show that automatically flushing subnormals to zero avoids the performance penalties. Our results show that the anticipated speedup of 2 over a double precision LU factorization is obtained only for the very largest of our test problems. For iterative solvers, we find that for the majority of the matrices computing or applying incomplete factorization preconditioners in single precision does not present sufficient performance benefits to justify the loss of accuracy compared with the use of double precision. We also find that using single precision for the matrix–vector product kernels provides an average speedup of 1.5 over double precision kernels, but new mixed precision algorithms are needed to exploit this benefit without losing the performance gain in the process of refining the solution to double precision accuracy.}

Our task decomposition goes one step further: it partitions the set of triangles in the graph. By streaming these small tasks to compute resources, we can solve problems that do not fit on a device. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by providing an implementation on a compute node with multiple sockets, cores and GPUs. The current state-of-the-art in triangle enumeration processes the Friendster graph in 2.1 seconds, not including data copy time between CPU and GPU. Using that metric, our approach is 20 percent faster. When copy times are included, our algorithm takes 3.2 seconds. This is 5.6 times faster than the fastest published CPU-only time.},

The paper studies the stability of the variable step explicit method and proposes a technique to guarantee integration stability specifically for interconnect systems. Although explicit methods require smaller integration steps compared to those of the traditional implicit techniques, they avoid the complex calculations inherent to implicit integration. The proposed approach is demonstrated using an RC VLSI interconnect model and results are compared to those achieved by Ngspice, a state-of-the-art implicit integration solver, implemented on the same parallel hardware. The results show that the speed-up of the parallelised explicit solution reaches one order of magnitude for large systems and is increasing with the circuit size.},

  abstract    = {Krylov methods provide a fast and highly parallel numerical tool for the iterative solution of many large-scale sparse linear systems. To a large extent, the performance of practical realizations of these methods is constrained by the communication bandwidth in all current computer architectures, motivating the recent investigation of sophisticated techniques to avoid, reduce, and/or hide the message-passing costs (in distributed platforms) and the memory accesses (in all architectures). This paper introduces a new communication-reduction strategy for the (Krylov) GMRES solver that advocates for decoupling the storage format (i.e., the data representation in memory) of the orthogonal basis from the arithmetic precision that is employed during the operations with that basis. Given that the execution time of the GMRES solver is largely determined by the memory access, the datatype transforms can be mostly hidden, resulting in the acceleration of the iterative step via a lower volume of bits being retrieved from memory. Together with the special properties of the orthonormal basis (whose elements are all bounded by 1), this paves the road toward the aggressive customization of the storage format, which includes some floating point as well as fixed point formats with little impact on the convergence of the iterative process. We develop a high performance implementation of the "compressed basis GMRES" solver in the Ginkgo sparse linear algebra library and using a large set of test problems from the SuiteSparse matrix collection we demonstrate robustness and performance advantages on a modern NVIDIA V100 GPU of up to 50\% over the standard GMRES solver that stores all data in IEEE double precision.},

It is found experimentally that the algorithm requires solving between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $\mathcal{O}(M^{0.36})$ linear systems involving weighted Laplacian matrices, where $M$ is the number of edges.

We next analyze Stochastic Cubic-Regularized Newton (SCRN) algorithm under interpolation-like conditions, and show that the oracle complexity to reach an $\epsilon$-local-minimizer under interpolation-like conditions, is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^{2.5})$. While this obtained complexity is better than the corresponding complexity of either PSGD, or SCRN without interpolation-like assumptions, it does not match the rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^{1.5})$ corresponding to deterministic Cubic-Regularized Newton method. It seems further Hessian-based interpolation-like assumptions are necessary to bridge this gap. We also discuss the corresponding improved complexities in the zeroth-order settings.},

Modern GPUs include Tensor Core Units (TCUs), which specialize in dense matrix multiplication. Our aim is to re-purpose TCUs for sparse matrices. The key idea of our spGEMM algorithm, tSparse, is to multiply sparse rectangular blocks using the mixed precision mode of TCUs. tSparse partitions the input matrices into tiles and operates only on tiles which contain one or more elements. It creates a task list of the tiles, and performs matrix multiplication of these tiles using TCUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that TCUs are used in the context of spGEMM. We show that spGEMM, with our tiling approach, benefits from TCUs. Our approach significantly improves the performance of spGEMM in comparison to cuSPARSE, CUSP, RMerge2, Nsparse, AC-SpGEMM and spECK.},

Prior research developed a model, TRIDENT to analytically predict Silent Data Corruption (SDC, i.e., incorrect output without any indication) probabilities of single-threaded CPU applications without requiring FIs. Unfortunately, TRIDENT is incompatible with GPU programs, due to their high degree of parallelism and different memory architectures than CPU programs. The main challenge is that modeling error propagation across thousands of threads in a GPU kernel requires enormous amounts of data to be profiled and analyzed, posing a major scalability bottleneck for HPC applications.\\ In this paper, we propose GPU-TRIDENT, an accurate and scalable technique for modeling error propagation in GPU programs. We find that GPU-TRIDENT is 2 orders of magnitude faster than FI-based approaches, and nearly as accurate in determining the SDC rate of GPU programs.}

An API for these kernels has been defined by the GraphBLAS project. The SuiteSparse project has implemented this API on shared-memory platforms, and the LAGraph project is building a library of graph algorithms using this API.\\ How does the matrix-based approach perform compared to the graph-based approach? Our experiments on a 56 core CPU show that for representative graph workloads, LAGraph/SuiteSparse solutions are 5$\times$ slower on the average than Galois solutions. We argue that this performance gap arises from inherent limitations of a matrix-based API: regardless of which architecture a matrixbased algorithm is run on, it is subject to the same inherent limitations of the matrix-based API.}

Algorithms interact with hardware in different ways and which graph solution works best on a given platform changes with the structure of the graph. This makes it difficult to decide which graph programming framework is the best for a given situation. In this paper, we try to make sense of this diverse landscape. We evaluate five different frameworks for graph analytics: SuiteSparse GraphBLAS, Galois, the NWGraph library, the Graph Kernel Collection (GKC), and GraphIt. We use the GAP Benchmark Suite to evaluate each framework. GAP consists of 30 tests: six graph algorithms (breadth-first search, single-source shortest path, PageRank, betweenness centrality, connected components, and triangle counting) on five graphs. The GAP Benchmark Suite includes high-performance reference implementations to provide a performance baseline for comparison. Our results show the relative strengths of each framework, but also serve as a case study for the challenges of establishing objective measures for comparing graph frameworks.}

  abstract    = {We propose QPALM, a nonconvex quadratic programming (QP) solver based on the proximal augmented Lagrangian method. This method solves a sequence of inner subproblems which can be enforced to be strongly convex and which therefore admit of a unique solution. The resulting steps are shown to be equivalent to inexact proximal point iterations on the extended-real-valued cost function. Furthermore, we prove global convergence of such iterations to a stationary point at an R-linear rate in the specific case of a (possibly nonconvex) QP. The QPALM algorithm solves the subproblems iteratively using semismooth Newton directions and an exact linesearch. The former can be computed efficiently in most iterations by making use of suitable factorization update routines, while the latter requires the zero of a monotone, piecewise affine function. QPALM is implemented in open-source C code, with tailored linear algebra routines for the factorization in a self-written package LADEL. The resulting implementation is shown to be extremely robust in numerical simulations, solving all of the Maros-Meszaros problems and finding a stationary point for most of the nonconvex QPs in the Cutest test set. Furthermore, it is shown to be competitive against state-of-the-art convex QP solvers in typical QPs arising from application domains such as portfolio optimization and model predictive control. As such, QPALM strikes a unique balance between solving both easy and hard problems efficiently.},

  abstract    = {High-performance computing (HPC) applications enable the solution of computeintensive problems in feasible time. Among many HPC paradigms, task-based programming has gathered community attention in recent years. This paradigm enables constructing an HPC application using a more declarative approach, structuring it in a direct acyclic graph (DAG). The performance evaluation of these applications is as hard as in any other programming paradigm. Understanding how to analyze these applications, employing the DAG and runtime metrics, presents opportunities to improve its performance. This article describes the StarVZ R-package available on CRAN for performance analysis of task-based applications. StarVZ enables transforms runtime trace data into different visualizations of the application behavior. An analyst can understand their applications' performance limitations and compare multiple executions. StarVZ has been successfully applied to several study-cases, showing its applicability in a number of scenarios.}

  abstract    = {Model predictive control (MPC) for linear dynamical systems requires solving an optimal control structured quadratic program (QP) at each sampling instant. This paper proposes a primal active-set strategy, called PRESAS, for the efficient solution of such block-sparse QPs, based on a preconditioned iterative solver to compute the search direction in each iteration. Rank-one factorization updates of the preconditioner result in a per-iteration computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(Nm^2)$, where m denotes the number of state and control variables and N the number of control intervals. Three different block-structured preconditioning techniques are presented and their numerical properties are studied further. In addition, an augmented Lagrangian based implementation is proposed to avoid a costly initialization procedure to find a primal feasible starting point. Based on a standalone C code implementation, we illustrate the computational performance of PRESAS against current state of the art QP solvers for multiple linear and nonlinear MPC case studies. We also show that the solver is real-time feasible on a dSPACE MicroAutoBox-II rapid prototyping unit for vehicle control applications, and numerical reliability is illustrated based on experimental results from a testbench of small-scale autonomous vehicles.}

Our approach uses either a trivial or a non-trivial Riemannian geometry of the search-space, and requires only minimal spectral information about the quadratic component of the objective function. We further show how the theory of Riemannian optimization promotes a deeper understanding of the Trust Region Subproblem and its difficulties, e.g. a deep connection between the Trust Region Subproblem and the problem of finding affine eigenvectors, and a new examination of the so-called hard case in light of the condition number of the Riemannian Hessian operator at a global optimum. Finally, we propose to incorporate preconditioning via a careful selection of a variable Riemannian metric, and establish bounds on the asymptotic convergence rate in terms of how well the preconditioner approximates the input matrix.},

  abstract  = {Tile low-rank general matrix multiplication (TLR GEMM) is a novel method of matrix multiplication on large data-sparse matrices, which can significantly reduce storage footprint and arithmetic complexity under given accuracy. To implement high-performance TLR GEMM on Sunway many-core processor, the following challenges remain to be addressed: 1) design an efficient parallel scheme; 2) provide an efficient kernel library of math functions commonly used in TLR GEMM. This paper proposes swTLR GEMM, an efficient implementation of TLR GEMM. We assign LR GEMM computation to a single computing processing element (CPE) and use grouped task queue to process different data tiles of the TLR matrix. Moreover, we implement an efficient kernel library (swLR Kernels) for low-rank matrix operations. To scale to massive (CGs), we organize the CGs into the CG grid and partition the matrices into blocks accordingly. We also apply Cannon's algorithm to enable efficient communication when processing the matrix blocks across CGs simultaneously. The experiment results show that the DGEMM kernel in swLR Kernels achieves 102$\times$ speedup on average. In terms of overall performance, swTLR GEMM-LLD and swTLR GEMM-LLL achieve 91$\times$ and 20.1$\times$ speedup on average, respectively. In addition, our implementation of swTLR GEMM exhibits good scalability when running on 1,024 CGs of Sunway processors (66,560 cores in total).},

  abstract    = {Sparse vectors, matrices, and tensors are commonly used to compress nonzero values of big data manipulated in data analytics, scientific simulations, and machine learning computations. As with general computations, parallelization of loops in sparse computations, codes manipulating sparse structures, is essential to efficiently utilize available parallel architectures. The sparse computations often exhibit partial parallelism in loops that are sequential in the corresponding dense computation due to sparsity of data dependencies coming from indirect memory access through index arrays, e.g. col in val[col[j]]. Such dependencies can only be discovered at runtime when content of index arrays are available. Consequently, performance programmers typically use the inspector/executor strategy to take advantage of partial parallelism in sparse computation. There, programmers implement an inspector code that creates iteration dependency graph at runtime from which wavefronts of iterations are extracted and fed into a parallel version of the computation called an executor. The executor executes iteration waves sequentially to respect sparse dependencies while executing iterations inside each wavefront in parallel.\\ To automate the generation of the inspector and executor code, compiler-based loop-carried data dependency analysis is needed. However, straightforward automatically generated inspectors typically have significantly higher overhead than hand written optimized ones. Consequently, the specific problem that I am addressing in this dissertation is how can we automate the strategies used by expert programmers to generate efficient runtime inspectors for parallelizing sparse computation.\\ The overarching contribution of this dissertation is an approach for encoding index array properties for individual index arrays and relationships between index arrays as universally quantified constraints and using them in compiler-based data dependence analysis. The dependence analysis is then evaluated in the context of finding wavefront parallelism in sparse computations. More specifically, one contribution is an approach to automatically use index array properties to prove more data dependencies unsatisfiable, removing the need for inspecting them at runtime. Other contributions are methods to use the same properties to simplify compiletime-satisfiable dependences by finding equalities and subset relationships enabling generation of faster runtime inspectors. The last contribution includes compile-time methods for expanding opportunities for array privatization in sparse computations by defining an array as private if its contents start and end each iteration with the same value. Evaluation results show my approach is able to find seven fully parallel loops in seven sparse computations where previous compiler-based approach could not, and efficiently extract partial parallelism from outer most loops of five out of six sparse computations.}

One popular solution method is based on the backward stable QR factorization of the system matrix A. This paper focuses on sparse-dense linear least squares problems, that is, problems where A is sparse except from a small number of rows that are considered to be dense. For large-scale problems, the direct application of a QR solver will fail because of a lack of memory or will be unacceptably slow. We study a number of approaches for solving such problems using a sparse QR solver without modication. We consider the case where the sparse part of A is rank-decient and show that either preprocessing A using partial matrix stretching or using regularization and employing a direct-iterative approach can be seamlessly combined with a black-box QR solver. Furthermore, we propose extending the augmented system formulation with iterative renement for sparse problems to sparse-dense problems and demonstrate experimentally that multi-precision variants can be successfully used.}

Existing Tucker decomposition algorithms usually rely on a single solver to compute the factor matrices and core tensor, and are not flexible enough to adapt with the diversities of the input data and the hardware. Moreover, to exploit highly efficient GEMM kernels, most Tucker decomposition implementations make use of explicit matricizations, which could introduce extra costs in terms of data conversion and memory usage. In this paper, we present a-Tucker, a new framework for input-adaptive and matricization-free Tucker decomposition of dense tensors. A mode-wise flexible Tucker decomposition algorithm is proposed to enable the switch of different solvers for the factor matrices and core tensor, and a machine-learning adaptive solver selector is applied to automatically cope with the variations of both the input data and the hardware. To further improve the performance and enhance the memory efficiency, we implement a-Tucker in a fully matricization-free manner without any conversion between tensors and matrices. Experiments with a variety of synthetic and real-world tensors show that a-Tucker can substantially outperform existing works on both CPUs and GPUs.},

(2019) that, if the quadratic growth condition holds at an optimal solution for the dual problem, then the KKT residual converges to zero R-superlinearly when the ALM is applied to the primal problem. Moreover, Cui et al (2017) provided sufficient conditions for the quadratic growth condition to hold under the metric subregularity and bounded linear regularity conditions for solving composite matrix optimization problems involving spectral functions. Here, we adopt these recent ideas to analyze the convergence properties of the ALM when applied to SOCPs. To the best of our knowledge, no similar work has been done for SOCPs so far. In our paper, we first provide sufficient conditions to ensure the quadratic growth condition for SOCPs. With these elegant theoretical guarantees, we then design an SOCP solver and apply it to solve various classes of SOCPs such as minimal enclosing ball problems, classic trust-region subproblems, square-root Lasso problems, and DIMACS Challenge problems. Numerical results show that the proposed ALM based solver is efficient and robust compared to the existing highly developed solvers such as Mosek and SDPT3.},

A common assembly paradigm identifies overlapping sequences, simplifies their layout, and creates consensus.

In this work, we introduce new distributed-memory parallel algorithms for overlap detection and layout simplification steps of de novo genome assembly, and implement them in the diBELLA 2D pipeline. Our distributed memory algorithms for both overlap detection and layout simplification are based on linear-algebra operations over semirings using 2D distributed sparse matrices. Our layout step consists of performing a transitive reduction from the overlap graph to a string graph. We provide a detailed communication analysis of the main stages of our new algorithms. diBELLA 2D achieves near linear scaling with over 80\% parallel efficiency for the human genome, reducing the runtime for overlap detection by 1.2-1.3$\times$ for the human genome and 1.5-1.9$\times$ for C. elegans compared to the state-of-the-art. Our transitive reduction algorithm outperforms an existing distributed-memory implementation by 10.5-13.3$\times$ for the human genome and 18-29$\times$ for the C. elegans.

  abstract  = {Fitting a specified model to data is critical in many science and engineering fields. A major task in fitting a specified model to data is to estimate the value of each parameter in the model. Iterative local methods, such as the Gauss-Newton method and the Levenberg-Marquardt method, are often employed for parameter estimation in nonlinear models. However, practitioners must guess the initial value for each parameter to initialize these iterative local methods. A poor initial guess can contribute to non-convergence of these methods or lead these methods to converge to a wrong or inferior solution. In this paper, a solution interval method is introduced to find the optimal estimator for each parameter in a nonlinear model that minimizes the squared error of the fit. The method includes three algorithms that require different level of computational power to find the optimal parameter estimators. The method constructs a solution interval for each parameter in the model. These solution intervals significantly reduce the search space for optimal parameter estimators. The method also provides an empirical probability distribution for each parameter, which is valuable for parameter uncertainty assessment. The solution interval method is validated through two case studies in which the Michaelis-Menten model and Fick's second law are fit to experimental data sets, respectively. These case studies show that the solution interval method can find optimal parameter estimators efficiently. A four-step procedure for implementing the solution interval method in practice is also outlined.},

  abstract    = {Sparse direct solvers using Block Low-Rank compression have been proven efficient to solve problems arising in many real-life applications. Improving those solvers is crucial for being able to 1) solve larger problems and 2) speed up computations. A main characteristic of a sparse direct solver using low-rank compression is when compression is performed. There are two distinct approaches: (1) all blocks are compressed before starting the factorization, which reduces the memory as much as possible, or (2) each block is compressed as late as possible, which usually leads to better speedup. The objective of this paper is to design a composite approach, to speedup computations while staying under a given memory limit. This should allow to solve large problems that cannot be solved with Approach 2 while reducing the execution time compared to Approach 1. We propose a memory-aware strategy where each block can be compressed either at the beginning or as late as possible. We first consider the problem of choosing when to compress each block, under the assumption that all information on blocks is perfectly known, i.e., memory requirement and execution time of a block when compressed or not. We show that this problem is a variant of the NP-complete Knapsack problem, and adapt an existing 2-approximation algorithm for our problem. Unfortunately, the required information on blocks depends on numerical properties and in practice cannot be known in advance. We thus introduce models to estimate those values. Experiments on the PaStiX solver demonstrate that our new approach can achieve an excellent trade-off between memory consumption and computational cost. For instance on matrix Geo1438, Approach 2 uses three times as much memory as Approach 1 while being three times faster. Our new approach leads to an execution time only 30\% larger than Approach 2 when given a memory 30\% larger than the one needed by Approach 1}

  abstract  = {The Gram–Schmidt process uses orthogonal projection to construct the $A = QR$ factorization of a matrix. When $Q$ has linearly independent columns, the operator $P = I - Q(Q^T Q)^{-1} Q^T$ defines an orthogonal projection onto $Q^\bot$. In finite precision, $Q$ loses orthogonality as the factorization progresses. A family of approximate projections is derived with the form $P = I - QT Q^T$, with correction matrix $T$. When $T = (Q^T Q)^{-1}$, and $T$ is triangular, it is postulated that the best achievable orthogonality is $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)\kappa(A)$. We present new variants of modified (MGS) and classical Gram–Schmidt algorithms that require one global reduction step. An interesting form of the projector leads to a compact $WY$ representation for MGS. In particular, the inverse compact $WY$ MGS algorithm is equivalent to a lower triangular solve. Our main contribution is to introduce a backward normalization lag into the compact $WY$ representation, resulting in a $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)\kappa([r_0, A V_m])$ stable Generalized Minimal Residual Method (GMRES) algorithm that requires only one global reduce per iteration. Further improvements in performance are achieved by accelerating GMRES on GPUs.},

This book uses these modern numerical tools to demonstrate how to solve nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in parallel. It starts from key mathematical concepts, such as Krylov space methods, preconditioning, multigrid, and Newton's method. In PETSc these components are composed at run time into fast solvers.\\ Discretizations are introduced from the beginning, with an emphasis on finite difference and finite element methodologies. The example C programs of the first 12 chapters, listed on the inside front cover, solve (mostly) elliptic and parabolic PDE problems. Discretization leads to large, sparse, and generally nonlinear systems of algebraic equations. For such problems, mathematical solver concepts are explained and illustrated through the examples, with sufficient context to speed further development.\\
PETSc for Partial Differential Equations\begin{itemize}
\item addresses both discretization and fast solvers for PDEs;
\item emphasizes practice more than theory;
\item contains well-structured examples, with advice on run-time solver choices;
\item demonstrates how to achieve high performance and parallel scalability; and
\item builds on the reader's understanding of fast solver concepts when applying the Firedrake
\end{itemize}
Python finite element solver library in the last two chapters.\\ This textbook, the first to cover PETSc programming for nonlinear PDEs, provides an on-ramp for graduate students and researchers to a major area of high-performance computing for science and engineering.

In many cases the solution of linear systems may take most of the simulation time thus representing a major bottleneck in the further development of scientific and technical software. For large scale simulations, nowadays accounting for several millions or even billions of unknowns, it is quite common to resort to preconditioned iterative solvers for exploiting their low memory requirements and, at least potential, parallelism. Approximate inverses have been shown to be robust and effective preconditioners in various contexts. In this work, we show how adaptive FSAI, an approximate inverse characterized by a very high degree of parallelism, can be successfully implemented on a distributed memory computer equipped with GPU accelerators. Taking advantage of GPUs in adaptive FSAI set-up is not a trivial task, nevertheless we show through an extensive numerical experimentation how the proposed approach outperforms more traditional preconditioners and results in a close-to-ideal behaviour in challenging linear algebra problems.},

Naive versions of conventional resilience techniques will not scale to the exascale regime: with a main memory footprint of tens of Petabytes, synchronously writing checkpoint data all the way to background storage at frequent intervals will create intolerable overheads in runtime and energy consumption. Forecasts show that the mean time between failures could be lower than the time to recover from such a checkpoint, so that large calculations at scale might not make any progress if robust alternatives are not investigated. More advanced resilience techniques must be devised. The key may lie in exploiting both advanced system features as well as specific application knowledge. Research will face two essential questions: (1) what are the reliability requirements for a particular computation and (2) how do we best design the algorithms and software to meet these requirements? One avenue would be to refine and improve on system- or application-level checkpointing and rollback strategies in the case an error is detected. Developers might use fault notification interfaces and flexible runtime systems to respond to node failures in an application-dependent fashion. Novel numerical algorithms or more stochastic computational approaches may be required to meet accuracy requirements in the face of undetectable soft errors. The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together a diverse group of scientists with expertise in exascale computing to discuss novel ways to make applications resilient against detected and undetected faults. In particular, participants explored the role that algorithms and applications play in the holistic approach needed to tackle this challenge.},

We argue for an instruction-based search space and we show: 1) how to exploit dynamic program information based on call stacks; and 2) how to exploit the iterative nature of scientific codes, combined with temporal locality. We applied the methodology to tune the implementation of scientific codes written in a combination of Python, CUDA, C++ and Fortran, tuning calls to math exp library functions. The iterative search refinement always reduces the search complexity and the number of steps to solution. Dynamic program information increases search efficacy. Using this approach, we obtain application runtime performance improvements up to 27\%.},

Specifically, we perform fault injection campaigns on a Jetson TK1 development kit, a board equipped with a SoC including an NVIDIA "Kepler" Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We evaluate the effect of modifying the size of the problem and also the thread-block size on the behaviour of the algorithms. Our results show that the block version of the matrix multiplication benchmark that leverages the shared memory of the GPU is not only faster than the element-wise version, but it is also much more resilient to soft errors. We also use the cuda-gdb debugger to analyze the main causes of the crashes in the code due to soft errors. Our experiments show that most of the errors are due to accesses to invalid positions of the different memories of the GPU, which causes that the block version suffers a higher percentage of this kind of errors.},

Many algorithms exist for graph coloring on a single GPU or in distributed memory, but hybrid MPI+GPU algorithms have been unexplored until this work, to the best of our knowledge. We present several MPI+GPU coloring approaches that use implementations of the distributed coloring algorithms of Gebremedhin et al. and the shared-memory algorithms of Deveci et al. The on-node parallel coloring uses implementations in KokkosKernels, which provide parallelization for both multicore CPUs and GPUs. We further extend our approaches to solve for distance-2 coloring, giving the first known distributed and multiGPU algorithm for this problem. In addition, we propose novel methods to reduce communication in distributed graph coloring.

To accelerate SPICE simulation without sacrificing accuracy, state-of-the-art approaches have started to employ GPUs to parallelize the LU-factorization and device linearization phases. Instead of focusing on these phases, this work demonstrates for the first time that when large circuits come into play, a new and equally important performance bottleneck emerges at the circuit setup phase. Speeding up the circuit setup phase in SPICE is our key focus in this paper. Our two implementations demonstrate that our GPU-based circuit setup reduces the analysis time from 4.5 days to merely 89 seconds for a 256-bit multiplier, which consists of more than 1M transistors. Our achieved speedup is 4396x compared to the baseline (open-source NGSPICE) and more than 2x compared to commercial (HSPICE and Spectre) SPICE circuit setup.},

  abstract  = {SpMV (Sparse matrix-vector multiplication) is widely used in many fields. Improving the performance of SpMV has been the pursuit of many researchers. Parallel SpMV using multi-core processors has been a standard parallel method used by researchers. In reality, the number of non-zero elements in many sparse matrices is not evenly distributed, so parallelism without preprocessing will cause a large amount of performance loss due to uneven load. In this paper, we propose ALBUS (Absolute Load Balancing Using SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)), a method for efficiently processing SpMV using load balancing and SIMD vectorization. On the one hand, ALBUS can achieve multi-core balanced load processing; on the other hand, it gives full play to the ability of SIMD vectorization parallelism under the CPU. We selected 20 sets of regular matrices and 20 sets of irregular matrices to form the Benchmark suite. We performed SpMV performance comparison tests on ALBUS, CSR5 (Compressed Sparse Row 5), Merge(Merge-based SpMV), and MKL (Math Kernel Library) under the same conditions. On the E5-2670 v3 CPU platform, For 20 sets of regular matrices, ALBUS can achieve an average speedup of 1.59x, 1.32x, 1.48x (up to 2.53x, 2.22x, 2.31x) compared to CSR5, Merge, MKL, respectively.

  abstract    = {Many problems in scientific and engineering applications contain sparse matrices or graphs as main input objects, e.g. numerical simulations on meshes. Large inputs are abundant these days and require parallel processing for memory size and speed. To optimize the execution of such simulations on cluster systems, the input problem needs to be distributed suitably onto the processing units (PUs). More and more frequently, such clusters contain different CPUs or a combination of CPUs and GPUs. This heterogeneity makes the load distribution problem quite challenging. Our study is motivated by the observation that established partitioning tools do not handle such heterogeneous distribution problems as well as homogeneous ones. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of balanced load distribution for heterogeneous architectures as a multi-objective, single-constraint optimization problem. We then split the problem into two phases and propose a greedy approach to determine optimal block sizes for each PU. These block sizes are then fed into numerous existing graph partitioners, for us to examine how well they handle the above problem. One of the tools we consider is an extension of our own previous work (von Looz et al, ICPP'18) called Geographer. Our experiments on well-known benchmark meshes indicate that only two tools under consideration are able to yield good quality. These two are Parmetis (both the geometric and the combinatorial variant) and Geographer. While Parmetis is faster, Geographer yields better quality on average.},

  abstract    = {The GMRES method is used to solve sparse, non-symmetric systems of linear equations arising from many scientific applications. The solver performance within a single node is memory bound, due to the low arithmetic intensity of its computational kernels. To reduce the amount of data movement, and thus, to improve performance, we investigated the effect of using a mix of single and double precision while retaining double-precision accuracy. Previous efforts have explored reduced precision in the preconditioner, but the use of reduced precision in the solver itself has received limited attention. We found that GMRES only needs double precision in computing the residual and updating the approximate solution to achieve double-precision accuracy, although it must restart after each improvement of single-precision accuracy. This finding holds for the tested orthogonalization schemes: Modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) and Classical Gram-Schmidt with Re-orthogonalization (CGSR). Furthermore, our mixed-precision GMRES, when restarted at least once, performed 19\% and 24\% faster on average than double-precision GMRES for MGS and CGSR, respectively. Our implementation uses generic programming techniques to ease the burden of coding implementations for different data types. Our use of the Kokkos library allowed us to exploit parallelism and optimize data management. Additionally, KokkosKernels was used when producing performance results. In conclusion, using a mix of single and double precision in GMRES can improve performance while retaining double-precision accuracy.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {Motivated by the advent of machine learning, the last few years saw the return of hardware-supported low-precision computing. Computations with fewer digits are faster and more memory and energy efficient, but can be extremely susceptible to rounding errors. An application that can largely benefit from the advantages of low-precision computing is the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), but a careful implementation and rounding error analysis are required to ensure that sensible results can still be obtained.\\ In this paper we study the accumulation of rounding errors in the solution of the heat equation, a proxy for parabolic PDEs, via Runge-Kutta finite difference methods using round-to-nearest (RtN) and stochastic rounding (SR). We demonstrate how to implement the scheme to reduce rounding errors and we derive \emph{a priori} estimates for local and global rounding errors. Let $u$ be the roundoff unit. While the worst-case local errors are $O(u)$ with respect to the discretization parameters, the RtN and SR error behavior is substantially different. We prove that the RtN solution is discretization, initial condition and precision dependent, and always stagnates for small enough $\Delta t$. Until stagnation, the global error grows like $O(u\Delta t^{-1})$. In contrast, we show that the leading order errors introduced by SR are zero-mean, independent in space and mean-independent in time, making SR resilient to stagnation and rounding error accumulation. In fact, we prove that for SR the global rounding errors are only $O(u\Delta t^{-1/4})$ in 1D and are essentially bounded (up to logarithmic factors) in higher dimensions.},

  abstract  = {Direct search is a methodology for derivative-free optimization whose iterations are characterized by evaluating the objective function using a set of polling directions. In deterministic direct search applied to smooth objectives, these directions must somehow conform to the geometry of the feasible region, and typically consist of positive generators of approximate tangent cones (which then renders the corresponding methods globally convergent in the linearly constrained case). One knows however from the unconstrained case that randomly generating the polling directions leads to better complexity bounds as well as to gains in numerical efficiency, and it becomes then natural to consider random generation also in the presence of constraints. In this paper, we study a class of direct-search methods based on sufficient decrease for solving smooth linearly constrained problems where the polling directions are randomly generated (in approximate tangent cones). The random polling directions must satisfy probabilistic feasible descent, a concept which reduces to probabilistic descent in the absence of constraints. Such a property is instrumental in establishing almost-sure global convergence and worst-case complexity bounds with overwhelming probability. Numerical results show that the randomization of the polling directions can be beneficial over standard approaches with deterministic guarantees, as it is suggested by the respective worst-case complexity bounds.},

  abstract  = {The task-based programming model associated with dynamic runtime systems has gained popularity for challenging problems because of workload imbalance, heterogeneous resources, or extreme concurrency. During the last decade, lowrank matrix approximations, where the main idea consists of exploiting data sparsity typically by compressing off-diagonal tiles up to an application-specific accuracy threshold, have been adopted to address the curse of dimensionality at extreme scale. In this paper, we create a bridge between the runtime and the linear algebra by communicating knowledge of the data sparsity to the runtime. We design and implement this synergistic approach with high user productivity in mind, in the context of the PaRSEC runtime system and the HiCMA numerical library. This requires to extend PaRSEC with new features to integrate rank information into the dataflow so that proper decisions can be taken at runtime. We focus on the tile low-rank (TLR) Cholesky factorization for solving 3D data-sparse covariance matrix problems arising in environmental applications. In particular, we employ the 3D exponential model of Matern matrix kernel, which exhibits challenging nonuniform high ranks in off-diagonal tiles. We first provide a dynamic data structure management driven by a performance model to reduce extra floating-point operations. Next, we optimize the memory footprint of the application by relying on a dynamic memory allocator, and supported by a rank-aware data distribution to cope with the workload imbalance. Finally, we expose further parallelism using kernel recursive formulations to shorten the critical path. Our resulting high-performance implementation outperforms existing data-sparse TLR Cholesky factorization by up to 7-fold on a large-scale distributed-memory system, while minimizing the memory footprint up to a 44-fold factor. This multidisciplinary work highlights the need to empower runtime systems beyond their original duty of task scheduling for servicing next-generation low-rank matrix algebra libraries.}

ZeroSpy also provides intuitive optimization guidance by revealing the locations where the redundant zeros happen in source lines and calling contexts.

We explore a variety of approaches for adding a subset of the positive semidefinite constraints of the second order sparse relaxation obtained by using the maximum cliques of the graph's chordal extension.

  abstract    = {The problem of learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) up to Markov equivalence is equivalent to the problem of finding a permutation of the variables that induces the sparsest graph. Without additional assumptions, this task is known to be NP-hard. Building on the minimum degree algorithm for sparse Cholesky decomposition, but utilizing DAG-specific problem structure, we introduce an efficient algorithm for finding such sparse permutations. We show that on jointly Gaussian distributions, our method with depth $w$ runs in $O(p^{w+3})$ time. We compare our method with $w = 1$ to algorithms for finding sparse elimination orderings of undirected graphs, and show that taking advantage of DAG-specific problem structure leads to a significant improvement in the discovered permutation. We also compare our algorithm to provably consistent causal structure learning algorithms, such as the PC algorithm, GES, and GSP, and show that our method achieves comparable performance with a shorter runtime. Thus, our method can be used on its own for causal structure discovery. Finally, we show that there exist dense graphs on which our method achieves almost perfect performance, so that unlike most existing causal structure learning algorithms, the situations in which our algorithm achieves both good performance and good runtime are not limited to sparse graphs.},

GT-SAGA is computationally efficient since it evaluates only one component gradient per node per iteration and achieves provably fast and robust performance by leveraging node-level variance reduction and network-level gradient tracking. For general smooth non-convex problems, we show almost sure and mean-squared convergence to a first-order stationary point and describe regimes of practical significance where GT-SAGA achieves a network-independent convergence rate and outperforms the existing approaches respectively. When the global cost function further satisfies the Polyak-Lojaciewisz condition, we show that GT-SAGA exhibits global linear convergence to an optimal solution in expectation and describe regimes of practical interest where the performance is network-independent and improves upon the existing work. Numerical experiments based on real-world datasets are included to highlight the behavior and convergence aspects of the proposed method.},

  abstract    = {The next generation HPC and data centers are likely to be reconfigurable and data-centric due to the trend of hardware specialization and the emergence of data-driven applications. In this paper, we propose ARENA -- an asynchronous reconfigurable accelerator ring architecture as a potential scenario on how the future HPC and data centers will be like. Despite using the coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) as the substrate platform, our key contribution is not only the CGRA-cluster design itself, but also the ensemble of a new architecture and programming model that enables asynchronous tasking across a cluster of reconfigurable nodes, so as to bring specialized computation to the data rather than the reverse. We presume distributed data storage without asserting any prior knowledge on the data distribution. Hardware specialization occurs at runtime when a task finds the majority of data it requires are available at the present node. In other words, we dynamically generate specialized CGRA accelerators where the data reside. The asynchronous tasking for bringing computation to data is achieved by circulating the task token, which describes the data-flow graphs to be executed for a task, among the CGRA cluster connected by a fast ring network. Evaluations on a set of HPC and data-driven applications across different domains show that ARENA can provide better parallel scalability with reduced data movement (53.9\%). Compared with contemporary compute-centric parallel models, ARENA can bring on average 4.37$\times$ speedup. The synthesized CGRAs and their task-dispatchers only occupy 2.93$mm^2$ chip area under 45nm process technology and can run at 800MHz with on average 759.8mW power consumption. ARENA also supports the concurrent execution of multi-applications, offering ideal architectural support for future high-performance parallel computing and data analytics systems.},

  abstract  = {Given two datasets of points (called Query and Training), the Group (K) Nearest-Neighbor (GKNN) query retrieves (K) points of the Training with the smallest sum of distances to every point of the Query. This spatial query has been studied during the recent years and several performance improving techniques and pruning heuristics have been proposed. In previous work, we presented the first MapReduce algorithm, consisting of alternating local and parallel phases, which can be used to effectively process the GKNN query when the Query fits in memory, while the Training one belongs to the Big Data category. In this paper, we present a significantly improved algorithm that incorporates a new high-performance refining method, a fast way to calculate distance sums for pruning purposes and several other minor coding and algorithmic improvements. Moreover, we transform this algorithm (which has been implemented in the Hadoop framework) to SpatialHadoop (a popular distributed framework that is dedicated to spatial processing), using a novel two-level partitioning method. Using real world and synthetic datasets, we also present a thorough experimental study of the Hadoop and SpatialHadoop versions of the algorithm, including a backstage analysis of the algorithm's performance, using metrics that highlight its internal functioning. Finally, we present an experimental comparison of the Hadoop, the SpatialHadoop versions and the version of our previous work, showing that the improved versions are the big winners, with the SpatialHadoop one being faster than its Hadoop counterpart.},

  abstract    = {This thesis explores the intricacies of obtaining high performance sparse matrixvector multiplication on modern hardware, with an emphasis on operating over data from small finite fields. We develop and present novel adaptations of classical, fast matrix multiplication algorithms over these fields and apply them in a sparse setting. Further, we compare these novel formats and algorithms to a wide array of standard sparse matrix formats. In particular, we use modern code analysis tools to show how data layouts, vector/panel widths, and choice of compiler all substantially influence the efficiency of the underlying arithmetic of these various sparse formats. These analyses are performed in a data-agnostic manner, meaning we focus solely on the efficiency of the arithmetic and not on higher-level aspects of performance such as cache access patterns. In particular, we analyze the assembly code produced by compilers, removing matrix-specific intangibles from the discussion of format. These are still important considerations when considering any specific matrix, but they make comparing general formats to one another difficult, without exhaustive benchmarking. These results show the theoretical peak arithmetic performance, which we discuss in this abstract, analytic perspective. We see similar trends in synthetic performance benchmarks. Ultimately, we show that the Method of the Four Russians can be directly adapted to sparse matrix-panel (a matrix with relatively few columns) multiplication and that a custom, high-performance variant can achieve high performance in sparse matrix-vector multiplication, with potential to perform better in real-world matrices.}

This paper presents a fully automatic toolchain that generates and formally verifies a guard-stable floating-point C program from its functional specification in real arithmetic. The generated program is instrumented to soundly detect when unstable guards may occur and, in these cases, to issue a warning.

Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the Lanczos method and truncated Chebyshev expansion, the proposed methods tend to provide more accurate approximations of $f(A)b$ at lower polynomial orders, and for matrices $A$ with a large number of distinct interior eigenvalues and a small spectral width.

This technique re-organizes the SGD computations into a form that communicates every $s$ iterations instead of every iteration, where $s$ is a tuning parameter. We prove theoretical flops, bandwidth, and latency upper bounds for SGD and its new communication-avoiding variant. Furthermore, we show experimental results that illustrate that the new Communication-Avoiding SGD (CA-SGD) method can achieve speedups of up to $4.97\times$ on a high-performance Infiniband cluster without altering the convergence behavior or accuracy.},

RMSErank1 is the Root Mean Square Error between a matrix and its rank-one decomposition. The NSGP problem is important for many societal applications such as identifying homogeneous communities in a spatial graph and detecting interrelated patterns in traffic accidents. This problem is NP-hard; it is computationally challenging because of the large size of spatial graphs and the constraint that the sub-graphs must be homogeneous, i.e. similar in terms of node attributes. This paper proposes a novel approach for finding a set of homogeneous sub-graphs that can minimize both the total RMSErank1 and edge-cuts while meeting the size constraint. Experiments and a case study using U.S. Census datasets and HP\#6 watershed network datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach partitions a spatial graph into a set of homogeneous sub-graphs and reduces the computational cost.}

Given an input (or “natural”) order, reordering aims to compute an alternate permutation of the vertices that is aimed at maximizing a locality-based objective. Given decades of research on this topic, there are tens of graph reordering schemes, and there are also several linear arrangement “gap” measures for treatment as objectives. However, a comprehensive empirical analysis of the efficacy of the ordering schemes against the different gap measures, and against real-world applications is currently lacking. In this study, we present an extensive empirical evaluation of up to 11 ordering schemes, taken from different classes of approaches, on a set of 34 real-world graphs emerging from different application domains. Our study is presented in two parts: a) a thorough comparative evaluation of the different ordering schemes on their effectiveness to optimize different linear arrangement gap measures, relevant to preserving locality; and b) extensive evaluation of the impact of the ordering schemes on two real-world, parallel graph applications, namely, community detection and influence maximization. Our studies show a significant divergence among the ordering schemes (up to 40x between the best and the poor) in their effectiveness to reduce the gap measures; and a wide ranging impact of the ordering schemes on various aspects including application runtime (up to 4x), memory and cache use, load balancing, and parallel work and efficiency. The comparative study also helps in revealing the nuances of a parallel environment (compared to serial) on the ordering schemes and their role in optimizing applications.},

However, it is not expected that key performance routines on relevant HPC applications will be performance portable as is, especially for common building blocks such as BLAS or DNN. The oneAPI the initiative aims to tackle this problem by combining a programming model, SYCL, with a set of interfaces for common building blocks that can be optimized for different hardware vendors. In particular, oneAPI includes the oneDNN performance library, which contains building blocks for deep learning applications and frameworks. By using the SYCL programming model, it can integrate easily with existing SYCL and C++ applications, sharing data and executing collaboratively on devices with the rest of the application. In this paper, we introduce a cuDNN backend for oneDNN, which allows running oneAPI applications on NVIDIA hardware taking advantage of existing building blocks from the CUDA ecosystem. We implement relevant neural networks (ResNet-50 and VGG16) on native CUDA and also a version of oneAPI with a CUDA backend, and demonstrate that performance portability can be achieved by leveraging existing building blocks for the target hardware.}

In this work, we address the challenges in achieving computation-communication overlap with overdecomposition on GPU systems using the Charm++ parallel programming system.

The introduction of very large number of cores at the processor level is challenging because it requires to handle multi level parallelism at various levels either coarse or fine to fully take advantage of the offered computing power. The induced programming effort can be fixed with parallel programming models based on the data flow model and the task programming paradigm [1]. To do so many of the standard numerical algorithms must be revisited as they cannot be easily parallelized at the finest levels. Iterative linear solvers are a key part of petroleum reservoir simulation as they can represent up to 80\% of the total computing time. In these algorithms, the standard preconditioning methods for large, sparse and unstructured matrices – such as Incomplete LU Factorization (ILU) or Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) – fail to scale on shared-memory architectures with large number of cores. In this paper we reconsider preconditioning algorithms to better introduce multi-level parallelism at both coarse level with MPI, fine level with threads and at the instruction level to enable SIMD optimizations. This paper illustrates how we enhance the implementation of preconditioners like the multilevel domain decomposition (DDML) preconditioners [2], based on the popular Additive Schwartz Method (ASM), or the classical ILU0 preconditioner with the fine grained parallel fixed point variant presented in [3]. Our approach is validated on linear systems extracted from realistic petroleum reservoir simulations. The robustness of the preconditioners is tested with respect to the data heterogeneities of the study cases. We evaluate the extensibility of our implementation regarding the model sizes and its scalability regarding the large number of cores provided by new KNL processors or multi-nodes clusters.}

We use Taylor series to linearize non-convex constraints, and introduce a set of consensus constraints to transform the centralized problem to a standard consensus optimization problem. A synchronous parallel algorithm is firstly proposed to solve the consensus optimization problem by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The ADMM framework allows us to decompose the coupling constraints and decision variables, leading to parallel iterations for each vehicle in a synchronous fashion. We then propose an asynchronous version of the parallel algorithm that allows the vehicles to update their variables asynchronously in the computation network. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are validated by extensive numerical simulations.},

  abstract    = {Sparse matrices are the key ingredients of several application domains, from scientific computation to machine learning. The primary challenge with sparse matrices has been efficiently storing and transferring data, for which many sparse formats have been proposed to significantly eliminate zero entries. Such formats, essentially designed to optimize memory footprint, may not be as successful in performing faster processing. In other words, although they allow faster data transfer and improve memory bandwidth utilization -- the classic challenge of sparse problems -- their decompression mechanism can potentially create a computation bottleneck. Not only is this challenge not resolved, but also it becomes more serious with the advent of domain-specific architectures (DSAs), as they intend to more aggressively improve performance. The performance implications of using various formats along with DSAs, however, has not been extensively studied by prior work. To fill this gap of knowledge, we characterize the impact of using seven frequently used sparse formats on performance, based on a DSA for sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV), implemented on an FPGA using high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, a growing and popular method for developing DSAs. Seeking a fair comparison, we tailor and optimize the HLS implementation of decompression for each format. We thoroughly explore diverse metrics, including decompression overhead, latency, balance ratio, throughput, memory bandwidth utilization, resource utilization, and power consumption, on a variety of real-world and synthetic sparse workloads.},

Critical node detection problem (CNDP) is one of the main issues in this literature, which aims to find a set of vertices whose removal maximizes or minimizes some objective function. In this paper, the focus is on solving CNDP, considering the size of the largest connected component as its objective function. In this regard, we introduce a new problem called K-Group-Division-Problem and present a mixed integer linear programming model to solve it. We prove that under certain circumstances, any optimal solution of the new problem is also an optimal solution of CNDP. Analyzing the performance of the proposed model on solving CNDP, indicates that this model is highly competitive against the base model in the literature. Furthermore, a novel exact algorithm is introduced which improves the proposed mixed integer linear programming model to address CNDP more efficiently. The results show that the proposed algorithm is much more efficient, and, compared with the base model, it can solve the problem on networks with a higher number of nodes.},

These representations do not have correctly rounded math libraries. Further, the use of existing FP libraries for these new representations can produce incorrect results. This paper proposes a novel approach for generating polynomial approximations that can be used to implement correctly rounded math libraries. Existing methods generate polynomials that approximate the real value of an elementary function $f(x)$ and produce wrong results due to approximation errors and rounding errors in the implementation. In contrast, our approach generates polynomials that approximate the correctly rounded value of $f(x)$ (i.e., the value of $f(x)$ rounded to the target representation). It provides more margin to identify efficient polynomials that produce correctly rounded results for all inputs. We frame the problem of generating efficient polynomials that produce correctly rounded results as a linear programming problem. Using our approach, we have developed correctly rounded, yet faster, implementations of elementary functions for multiple target representations.}

However, the communication bottleneck between GPUs, distributed across HPC nodes within a cluster, has limited achievable scalability of GPU-centric applications. Advances in inter-node GPU communication such as NVIDIA's GPUDirect have made great strides in addressing this issue. The added software development complexity has been addressed by simplified GPU programming paradigms such as Unified or Managed Memory. To understand the performance of these new features, new benchmarks were developed. Unfortunately, these benchmark efforts do not include correctness checking and certain messaging patterns used in applications. In this paper we highlight important gaps in communication benchmarks and motivate a methodology to help application developers understand the performance tradeoffs of different data movement options. Furthermore, we share systems tuning and deployment experiences across different GPU-aware MPI implementations. In particular, we demonstrate correctness testing is needed along with performance testing through modifications to an existing benchmark. In addition, we present a case study where existing benchmarks fail to characterize how data is moved within SW4, a seismic wave application, and create a benchmark to model this behavior. Finally, we motivate the need for an applicationinspired benchmark methodology to assess system performance and guide application programmers on how to use the system more efficiently.}

WDS is designed to abstract details of the underlying data structures away from the user, thus easing application development and optimisation. We show that using WDS does not significantly impact achieved performance across a variety of different scientific benchmarks and proxy-applications, compilers, and different architectures. The overheads are largely below 30\% for smaller problems, with the overhead deceasing to below 10\% when using larger problems. This shows that the library does not significantly impact the performance, while providing additional functionality to data structures, and the ability to optimise data structures without changing the application code.}

Within the system, we propose a novel dynamic partition architecture for training these models, achieving at least one half of communication reduction compared to existing training systems. According to our evaluations on real-world networks, our system delivers a competitive accuracy for the trained embeddings, and significantly accelerates the training process of the graph node embedding neural network,achieving a speedup of 7.23$\times$ and 18.6$\times$ over the existing fastest training system on single node and multi-node, respectively. As for the scalability, our experiments show that EDGES obtains a nearly linear speedup.},

Starting without the burden of legacy code, a holistic performance engineering process could be deployed across the traditional software layers to identify efficient implementations and guide sustainable software development. At the basic building blocks level, a flexible MPI+X programming approach was implemented together with a new sparse data structure (SELL-C-$\sigma$) to support heterogeneous architectures by design. Furthermore, ESSEX focused on hardware-efficient kernels for all relevant architectures and efficient data structures for block vector formulations of the eigensolvers. The algorithm layer addressed standard, generalized, and nonlinear eigenvalue problems and provided some widely usable solver implementations including a block JacobiDavidson algorithm, contour-based integration schemes, and filter polynomial approaches. Adding to the highly efficient kernel implementations, algorithmic advances such as adaptive precision, optimized filtering coefficients, and preconditioning have further improved time to solution. These developments were guided by the field of quantum physics applications, and especially by current topics such as topological insulator systems or problems from graphene research. For these, ScaMaC, a scalable matrix generation framework for a broad set of quantum physics problems, was developed. As the central software core of ESSEX, the PHIST library for sparse linear and eigenvalue problems has been established. It abstracts algorithmic developments from low-level optimization. Finally, central ESSEX software components and solvers have demonstrated scalability and hardware efficiency on up to 256 K cores using million-way process/thread-level parallelism.},

The community has done considerable work on proposing new methods for sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) computations and iterative sparse solvers on graphical processing units (GPUs). Due to vast variations in matrix features, no single method performs well across all sparse matrices. A few tools on automatic prediction of best-performing SpMV kernels have emerged recently and require many more efforts to fully utilize their potential. The utilization of a GPU by the existing SpMV kernels is far from its full capacity. Moreover, the development and performance analysis of SpMV techniques on GPUs have not been studied in sufficient depth. This paper proposes DIESEL, a deep learning-based tool that predicts and executes the best performing SpMV kernel for a given matrix using a feature set carefully devised by us through rigorous empirical and mathematical instruments. The dataset comprises 1056 matrices from 26 different real-life application domains including computational fluid dynamics, materials, electromagnetics, economics, and more. We propose a range of new metrics and methods for performance analysis, visualization, and comparison of SpMV tools. DIESEL provides better performance with its accuracy 88.2\%, workload accuracy 91.96\%, and average relative loss 4.4\%, compared to 85.9\%, 85.31\%, and 7.65\% by the next best performing artificial intelligence (AI)-based SpMV tool. The extensive results and analyses presented in this paper provide several key insights into the performance of the SpMV tools and how these relate to the matrix datasets and the performance metrics, allowing the community to further improve and compare basic and AI-based SpMV tools in the future.},

This type of problem is computationally challenging because the vector space dimension grows exponentially with the physical system size, and averaging over different configurations of the random disorder is needed to obtain relevant statistical behavior. For each eigenvalue problem, eigenvalues from different regions of the spectrum and their corresponding eigenvectors need to be computed. Traditionally, the interior eigenstates for a single eigenvalue problem are computed via the shift-and-invert Lanczos algorithm. Due to the extremely high memory footprint of the LU factorizations, this technique is not well suited for large number of spins $L$, e.g., one needs thousands of compute nodes on modern high performance computing infrastructures to go beyond $L = 24$. The matrix-free approach does not suffer from this memory bottleneck, however, its scalability is limited by a computation and communication imbalance. We present a few strategies to reduce this imbalance and to significantly enhance the scalability of the matrix-free eigensolver. To optimize the communication performance, we leverage the consistent space runtime, CSPACER, and show its efficiency in accelerating the MBL irregular communication patterns at scale compared to optimized MPI non-blocking two-sided and one-sided RMA implementation variants. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by computing eigenstates on a massively parallel many-core high performance computer.},

The central component of the framework is a collection of specialized preconditioned methods for nonlinear least squares: the classical three-term recurrence relation of Conjugate Gradients and related methods is replaced by a specific choice of six-term recurrence relation, which is used to reformulate the resulting optimization problem and eliminate several costly matrix-vector products. We demonstrate that this reformulation leads to improved performance, robustness, and accuracy for a synthetic example application from hydrogeology. The proposed prior-preconditioned caching CG scheme is the only one among the considered CG methods that scales perfectly in the number of estimated parameters. In the highly relevant case of sparse measurements, the proposed method is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the classical CG scheme, and at least six times faster than a prior-preconditioned, non-caching version. It is therefore particularly suited for the large-scale inversion of sparse observations.}

However, less attention was devoted to other aspects of graph processing such as handling typed and attributed graphs (also known as property graphs), and making use of complex graph query techniques (handling paths, aggregation, and filtering). To study these problems in more detail, we have used GraphBLAS to solve the case study of the 2014 SIGMOD Programming Contest, which defines complex graph processing tasks that require a diverse set of operations. Our solution makes heavy use of multi-source BFS algorithms expressed as sparse matrix-matrix multiplications along with other GraphBLAS techniques such as masking and submatrix extraction. While the queries can be formulated in GraphBLAS concisely, our performance evaluation shows mixed results. For some queries and data sets, the performance is competitive with the hand-optimized top solutions submitted to the contest, however, in some cases, it is currently outperformed by orders of magnitude.}

Overdecomposition has been successfully adopted on traditional CPU-based systems to achieve computation-communication overlap, significantly reducing the impact of communication on application performance. However, it has been unclear whether overdecomposition can provide the same benefits on modern GPU systems. In this work, we address the challenges in achieving computation-communication overlap with overdecomposition on GPU systems using the Charm++ parallel programming system. By prioritizing communication with CUDA streams in the application and supporting asynchronous progress of GPU operations in the Charm++ runtime system, we obtain improvements in overall performance of up to 50\% and 47\% with proxy applications Jacobi3D and MiniMD, respectively.}

However, existing STD algorithms face the problem of intermediate variables explosion which results from the fact that the formation of those variables, i.e., matrices Khatri-Rao product, Kronecker product, and matrix-matrix multiplication, follows the whole elements in sparse tensor. The above problems prevent deep fusion of efficient computation and big data platforms. To overcome the bottleneck, a novel stochastic optimization strategy (SGD$\_$Tucker) is proposed for STD which can automatically divide the high-dimension intermediate variables into small batches of intermediate matrices. Specifically, SGD$\_$Tucker only follows the randomly selected small samples rather than the whole elements, while maintaining the overall accuracy and convergence rate. In practice, SGD$\_$Tucker features the two distinct advancements over the state of the art. First, SGD$\_$Tucker can prune the communication overhead for the core tensor in distributed settings. Second, the low data-dependence of SGD$\_$Tucker enables fine-grained parallelization, which makes SGD$\_$Tucker obtaining lower computational overheads with the same accuracy. Experimental results show that SGD$\_$Tucker runs at least 2$X$ faster than the state of the art.},

  abstract = {Like any other scientific discipline, the High Performance Computing community suffers under the publish or perish paradigm. As a result, a significant portion of novel algorithm designs and hardware-optimized implementations never make it into production code but are instead abandoned once they served the purpose of yielding (another) publication. At the same time, community software packages driving scientific research lack the addition of new technology and hardware-specific implementations. This results in a very unsatisfying situation where researchers and software developers are working independently, and the traditional peer reviewing is reaching its capacity limits. A paradigm shift that accepts high-quality software pull requests to open source research software as conference contributions may create incentives to realize new and/or improved algorithms in community software ecosystems. In this paper, we propose to complement code reviews on pull requests to scientific open source software with scientific reviews, and allow the presentation and publication of high quality software contributions that present an academic improvement to the state-of-the-art at scientific conferences.},

We analyse in details the auxiliary schemes for the third- and second-order tensor methods. The auxiliary problems for the third-order scheme can be solved very efficiently by a linearly convergent gradient-type method with a preconditioner. The most expensive operation in this process is a preliminary factorization of the Hessian of the objective function. For solving the auxiliary problem for the second order scheme, we suggest two variants of the Fast Gradient Methods with restart, which converge as $O(\frac{1}{k^6})$, where $k$ is the iteration counter.

For the special case of parametric constrained least-squares problems that arise from model predictive control (MPC) formulations, we propose a novel and very efficient QR factorization method for equality constraint elimination. Together with SVD or $K$-SVD, the method provides a numerically robust alternative to standard condensing and move blocking, and to other complexity reduction methods for MPC based on basis functions. We show the good performance of the proposed techniques in numerical tests and in a linearized MPC problem of a nonlinear benchmark process.},

Our BFS implementation on RCM-reordered graph data achieves 326.48 MTEPS/W (mega TEPS per watt) on an ARMv8 system, ranking 2nd on the Green Graph500 list in June 2020 (the 1st rank uses GPU acceleration).},

This can be considered as a generalization of the classical non-negative matrix tri-factorization problem and includes a non-convex objective function which is a multivariate sixth degree polynomial and a has convex feasibility set. It has a special importance in data science, since it serves as a mathematical model for the fusion of different data sources in data clustering. We develop four methods to solve the SNMTF. They are based on four theoretical approaches known from the literature: the fixed point method (FPM), the block-coordinate descent with projected gradient (BCD), the gradient method with exact line search (GM-ELS) and the adaptive moment estimation method (ADAM). For each of these methods we offer a software implementation: for the former two methods we use Matlab and for the latter Python with the TensorFlow library. We test these methods on three data-sets: the synthetic data-set we generated, while the others represent real-life similarities between different objects. Extensive numerical results show that with sufficient computing time all four methods perform satisfactorily and ADAM most often yields the best mean square error ($\mathrm{MSE}$). However, if the computation time is limited, FPM gives the best $\mathrm{MSE}$ because it shows the fastest convergence at the beginning. All data-sets and codes are publicly available on our GitLab profile.},

  abstract    = {Designing efficient and scalable sparse linear algebra kernels on modern multi-GPU based HPC systems is a daunting task due to significant irregular memory references and workload imbalance across the GPUs. This is particularly the case for Sparse Triangular Solver (SpTRSV) which introduces additional two-dimensional computation dependencies among subsequent computation steps. Dependency information is exchanged and shared among GPUs, thus warrant for efficient memory allocation, data partitioning, and workload distribution as well as fine-grained communication and synchronization support. In this work, we demonstrate that directly adopting unified memory can adversely affect the performance of SpTRSV on multi-GPU architectures, despite linking via fast interconnect like NVLinks and NVSwitches. Alternatively, we employ the latest NVSHMEM technology based on Partitioned Global Address Space programming model to enable efficient fine-grained communication and drastic synchronization overhead reduction. Furthermore, to handle workload imbalance, we propose a malleable task-pool execution model which can further enhance the utilization of GPUs. By applying these techniques, our experiments on the NVIDIA multi-GPU supernode V100-DGX-1 and DGX-2 systems demonstrate that our design can achieve on average 3.53x (up to 9.86x) speedup on a DGX-1 system and 3.66x (up to 9.64x) speedup on a DGX-2 system with 4-GPUs over the Unified-Memory design. The comprehensive sensitivity and scalability studies also show that the proposed zero-copy SpTRSV is able to fully utilize the computing and communication resources of the multi-GPU system.},

Therefore, several heuristic acceleration techniques are introduced in the greedy basis generation algorithm, that is built upon a residual-based error indicator, to further boost up its computational efficiency. Several numerical experiments are conducted, which illustrate the favorable computational efficiency of our proposed ROM-accelerated ParaDIAG preconditioner, in comparison with the state of the art multigrid-based ParaDIAG preconditioner.},

Considering the challenges from large-scale, partially unknown complex environments, a three-layer motion planning framework is elaborately designed, including global path planning, local path optimization, and time-optimal velocity planning. Compared with existing approaches, the novelty of this work is twofold: 1) a heuristic-guided pruning strategy of motion primitives is newly designed and fully integrated into the search-based global path planner to improve the computational efficiency of graph search, and 2) a novel soft-constrained local path optimization approach is proposed, wherein the sparse-banded system structure of the underlying optimization problem is fully exploited to efficiently solve the problem. We validate the safety, smoothness, flexibility, and efficiency of EffMoP in various complex simulation scenarios and challenging real-world tasks. It is shown that the computational efficiency is improved by 66.21\% in the global planning stage and the motion efficiency of the robot is improved by 22.87\% compared with the recent quintic B\'{e}zier curve-based state space sampling approach.},

Then we give a list of problems that can be solved efficiently to find the global minimizer by exploiting the structure of the problem as much as it is possible. Another way to deal with non-convexity is to relax the goal from finding the global minimum to finding a stationary point or a local minimum. For this setting, we first present known results for the convergence rates of deterministic first-order methods, which are then followed by a general theoretical analysis of optimal stochastic and randomized gradient schemes, and an overview of the stochastic first-order methods. After that, we discuss quite general classes of non-convex problems, such as minimization of $\alpha$-weakly-quasi-convex functions and functions that satisfy Polyak--Lojasiewicz condition, which still allow obtaining theoretical convergence guarantees of first-order methods. Then we consider higher-order and zeroth-order/derivative-free methods and their convergence rates for non-convex optimization problems.},

We describe a generalization of this method to tensors, for computing the best low multilinear rank approximation of large and sparse tensors. In analogy to the matrix case, the large tensor is only accessed in multiplications between the tensor and blocks of vectors, thus avoiding excessive memory usage. It is proved that, if the starting approximation is good enough, then the tensor Krylov-Schur method is convergent. Numerical examples are given for synthetic tensors and sparse tensors from applications, which demonstrate that for most large problems the Krylov-Schur method converges faster and more robustly than higher order orthogonal iteration.},

By analyzing sparse computation programs at a higher level, our optimizer is able to remove the majority of unnecessary list generation tasks. To provide maximum programming flexibility, our optimization system conducts on-the-fly optimization of the whole computational graph consisting of Taichi kernels. The optimized Taichi kernels are then just-in-time compiled in parallel, and dispatched to parallel devices such as multithreaded CPU and massively parallel GPUs. Without any code modification on Taichi programs, our new system leads to $3.07 - 3.90\times$ fewer kernel launches and $1.73 - 2.76\times$ speed up on our benchmarks including sparse-grid physical simulation and differentiable programming.},

On the other hand, the projection subspace associated with interior variables is built independently in each subdomain by exploiting local eigenmodes and matrix resolvent approximations. The sought eigenpairs are then approximated by a Rayleigh--Ritz projection onto the subspace formed by the union of these two subspaces. Several theoretical and practical details are discussed, and upper bounds of the approximation errors are provided.

  abstract  = {Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) is a fundamental workload of numerous applications. However, for today's high-end superscalar CPUs, such as Intel Xeon series, it is usually difficult to efficiently perform SpMV due to the irregular, matrix-dependent data access and computation pattern. While many researches focus on optimizing the memory bandwidth bound by improving data locality, this work dives into the execution of SpMV computation on Intel Xeon CPU and reveals that the bad-speculation penalty is significant in many sparse matrices and too expensive to be ignored. We study and characterize sparsity structure types that are more vulnerable to the cache miss penalty or the bad speculation penalty, respectively. Based on this insight, we proposed a fast preprocessing method, which divides the matrix into sub-matrices and determines the critical performance bound of sub-matrices according to the data distribution characteristics. On each submatrix, a combination of dedicated row reordering strategies is performed to efficiently alleviate its key performance bounds: bad speculation, cache miss, or both. Our matrix representation is based on standard Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format, and can be easily adapted to existing SpMV libraries. Our approach is evaluated on Intel Xeon Gold 6146 Processor with a wide-range of matrices from the SuiteSparse benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an average 1.8$\times$ speedup (up to 2.5$\times$) on multi-threaded MKL Sparse Routines, with a quite low pre-processing cost. Additionally, when used in conjunction with MKL's original optimization method, our approach can further prompt the speedup, to average 3.6 $\times$ (up to 8.3 $\times$), This result indicates that our method can serve as a fast and wide-spectrum optimization method which is compatible with existing routines.}

One of its difficulties is related to unstable tests, where the execution can take different branches for real and floating-point numbers. This paper presents a new verification technique for numerical properties, named Runtime Abstract Interpretation (RAI), that, given an annotated source code, embeds into it an abstract analyzer in order to analyze the program behavior at runtime. RAI is a hybrid technique combining abstract interpretation and runtime verification that aims at being sound as the former while taking benefit from the concrete run to gain greater precision from the latter when necessary. It solves the problem of unstable tests by surrounding an unstable test by two carefully defined program points, forming a so-called split-merge section, for which it separately analyzes different executions and merges the computed domains at the end of the section. The implementation of this technique relies on two basic tools, FLDCompiler, that performs a source-to-source transformation of the given program and defines the split-merge sections, and an instrumentation library FLDLib that provides necessary primitives to explore relevant (partial) executions of each section and propagate accuracy properties. Initial experiments show that the proposed technique can efficiently and soundly analyze numerical accuracy for industrial programs on thin numerical scenarios.},

With weak admissibility, $BLR^2$ matrices reduce to block separable matrices (the flat version of HBS/HSS).

Then, we specify our GN scheme to handle the symmetric case and prove its convergence, where AMA is not applicable. Next, we incorporate our GN scheme into the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to develop an ADMM-GN algorithm.

  abstract  = {Matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a widely used linear algebra primitive common in scientific computing and data sciences. While several highly-tuned libraries and implementations exist, these typically target either sparse or dense matrices. The performance of these tuned implementations on unsupported types can be poor, and this is critical in cases where the structure of the computations is associated with varying degrees of sparsity. One such example is Algebraic Multigrid (AMG), a popular solver and preconditioner for large sparse linear systems. In this work, we present a new divide and conquer sparse GEMM, that is also highly performant and scalable when the matrix becomes dense, as in the case of AMG matrix hierarchies. In addition, we implement a lossless data compression method to reduce the communication cost. We combine this with an efficient communication pattern during distributed-memory GEMM to provide 2.24 times (on average) better performance than the state-of-the-art library PETSc. Additionally, we show that the performance and scalability of our method surpass PETSc even more when the density of the matrix increases. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by comparing our GEMM with PETSc on a wide range of matrices.}

  abstract    = {This work is based on the seminar titled "Resiliency in Numerical Algorithm Design for Extreme Scale Simulations" held March 1-6, 2020 at Schloss Dagstuhl, that was attended by all the authors. Advanced supercomputing is characterized by very high computation speeds at the cost of an enormous amount of resources. A typical large-scale computation running for 48 hours on a system consuming 20 MW, as predicted for exascale systems, would consume a million kWh, corresponding to about 100k Euro in energy cost for executing $10^23$ floating-point operations. It is clearly unacceptable to lose the whole computation if any of the several million parallel processes fails during the execution. Moreover, if a single operation suffers from a bit-flip error, should the whole computation be declared invalid? What about the notion of reproducibility itself: should this core paradigm of science be revised and refined for results that are obtained by large scale simulation?\\ Naive versions of conventional resilience techniques will not scale to the exascale regime: with a main memory footprint of tens of Petabytes, synchronously writing checkpoint data all the way to background storage at frequent intervals will create intolerable overheads in runtime and energy consumption. Forecasts show that the mean time between failures could be lower than the time to recover from such a checkpoint, so that large calculations at scale might not make any progress if robust alternatives are not investigated.\\ More advanced resilience techniques must be devised. The key may lie in exploiting both advanced system features as well as specific application knowledge. Research will face two essential questions: (1) what are the reliability requirements for a particular computation and (2) how do we best design the algorithms and software to meet these requirements? While the analysis of use cases can help understand the particular reliability requirements, the construction of remedies is currently wide open. One avenue would be to refine and improve on system- or application-level checkpointing and rollback strategies in the case an error is detected. Developers might use fault notification interfaces and flexible runtime systems to respond to node failures in an application-dependent fashion. Novel numerical algorithms or more stochastic computational approaches may be required to meet accuracy requirements in the face of undetectable soft errors. These ideas constituted an essential topic of the seminar.\\ The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together a diverse group of scientists with expertise in exascale computing to discuss novel ways to make applications resilient against detected and undetected faults. In particular, participants explored the role that algorithms and applications play in the holistic approach needed to tackle this challenge. This article gathers a broad range of perspectives on the role of algorithms, applications, and systems in achieving resilience for extreme scale simulations. The ultimate goal is to spark novel ideas and encourage the development of concrete solutions for achieving such resilience holistically.}

To compute digital waves, there are various techniques have been used the trigonometric function, but it needs a huge usage of memory. CORDIC algorithm has a flexible feature when compared with other algorithms the quantization accuracy is high. The major problem in this CORDIC algorithm is the linear rate of convergence with the speed of the iteration. The overall performance is affected by several numbers of shifts-add operations and high power consumption. The main aim of the improved CORDIC algorithm is to utilize an integrated adder subtractor in place of binary adder subtractor to decrease the count of iterations and hardware reduction technique. The improved CORDIC splits the rotation angle into several series of micro-rotation angles to calculate the rotation and the new set of angle provides a fast convergence. The Canonical signed-digit (CSD) approach together with Hcub algorithm employs for the number of adder subtractor reduction and shifters in CORDIC architecture design. The performances of the proposed CORDIC design have been verified by employing it in FFT implementation. The simulation result indicates the higher frequency of 77.20\%, 82.78\%, 78.30\% and 76.57\% when compared with conventional methods. The evaluation of FFT is also done by comparing with the conventional methods and the proposed FFT is better for CORDIC design. The power consumption, number of iterations and the hardware complexity reduce by using the improved CORDIC and the working of this proposed algorithm is evaluated through the FPGA implementation.},

  abstract     = {In probabilistic state inference, we seek to estimate the state of an (autonomous) agent from noisy observations. It can be shown that, under certain assumptions, finding the estimate is equivalent to solving a linear least squares problem. Solving such a problem is done by calculating the upper triangular matrix $R$ from the coefficient matrix $A$, using the $QR$ or Cholesky factorizations; this matrix is commonly referred to as the "square root matrix". In sequential estimation problems, we are often interested in periodic optimization of the state variable order, e.g., to reduce fill-in, or to apply a predictive variable ordering tactic; however, changing the variable order implies expensive re-factorization of the system. Thus, we address the problem of modifying an existing square root matrix $R$, to convey reordering of the variables. To this end, we identify several conclusions regarding the effect of column permutation on the factorization, to allow efficient modification of $R$, without accessing $A$ at all, or with minimal re-factorization. The proposed parallelizable algorithm achieves a significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art incremental smoothing and mapping approach, which considers incremental factorization on updates.}

Most existing frameworks for processing streaming, dynamic graphs are too limited in scalability or functionality to efficiently handle these increasingly massive graphs. Many frameworks are either built for shared memory platforms only (limiting the size of the graph that can be stored) or for distributed platforms, but run on slow, high overhead, interpreted, and bulk synchronous platforms. This paper introduces HOOVER, a high performance streaming graph modeling and analysis framework built from scratch to scale on high performance systems and extremely dynamic graphs. HOOVER offers similar APIs to previous streaming graph frameworks, but sits on top of a high performance runtime system designed for modern supercomputers. HOOVER leverages an eventually-consistent consistency model to improve scalability, and offers a number of unique features to users. On micro-benchmarks, HOOVER is shown to be comparable or faster than existing high performance and distributed graph frameworks. Using mini-apps, we also show that HOOVER easily scales to 2,048 PEs on more realistic applications.}

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a basis training algorithm for discriminative non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) with applications to single-channel audio source separation. With an NMF-based approach to supervised audio source separation, NMF is first applied to train the basis spectra of each source using training examples and then applied to the spectrogram of a mixture signal using the pretrained basis spectra at test time. The source signals can then be separated out using a Wiener filter. Here, a typical way to train the basis spectra is to minimize the dissimilarity measure between the observed spectrogram and the NMF model. However, obtaining the basis spectra in this way does not ensure that the separated signal will be optimal at test time due to the inconsistency between the objective functions for training and separation (Wiener filtering). To address this mismatch, a framework called discriminative NMF (DNMF) has recently been proposed. While this framework is noteworthy in that it uses a common objective function for training and separation, the objective function becomes more analytically complex than that of regular NMF. In the original DNMF work, a multiplicative update algorithm was proposed for the basis training; however, the convergence of the algorithm is not guaranteed and can be very slow. To overcome this weakness, this paper proposes a convergence-guaranteed algorithm for DNMF based on a majorization-minimization principle. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperform the conventional DNMF algorithm as well as the regular NMF algorithm in terms of both the signal-to-distortion and signal-tointerference ratios.},

  abstract    = {A key challenge in modern computing systems is to access data fast enough to fully utilize the computing elements in the chip. In Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), the performance is often constrained by register file size, memory bandwidth, and the capacity of the main memory. One important technique towards alleviating this challenge is data compression. By reducing the amount of data that needs to be communicated or stored, memory resources crucial for performance can be eciently utilized.\\ This thesis provides a set of approximation and compression techniques for GPUs, with the goal of eciently utilizing the computational fabric, and thereby increase performance. The thesis shows that these techniques can substantially lower the amount of information the system has to process, and are thus important tools in the process of meeting challenges in memory utilization. This thesis makes contributions within three areas: controlled floating-point precision reduction, lossless and lossy memory compression, and distributed training of neural networks. In the first area, the thesis shows that through automated and controlled floating-point approximation, the register file can be more eciently utilized. This is achieved through a framework which establishes a cross-layer connection between the application and the microarchitecture layer, and a novel register file organization capable of leveraging low-precision floatingpoint values and narrow integers for increased capacity and performance.\\ Within the area of compression, this thesis aims at increasing the effective bandwidth of GPUs by presenting a lossless and lossy memory compression algorithm to reduce the amount of transferred data. In contrast to state-ofthe-art compression techniques such as Base-Delta-Immediate and Bitplane Compression, which uses intra-block bases for compression, the proposed algorithm leverages multiple global base values to reach a higher compression ratio. The algorithm includes an optional approximation step for floating-point values which offers higher compression ratio at a given, low, error rate.\\ Finally, within the area of distributed training of neural networks, this thesis proposes a subgraph approximation scheme for graph data which mitigates accuracy loss in a distributed setting. The scheme allows neural network models that use graphs as inputs to converge at single-machine accuracy, while minimizing synchronization overhead between the machines.}

This article constructs mapping correspondence between eliminated tree nodes and quotient graph nodes through graph and quotient graph theories. The Approximate Minimum Degree (AMD) of quotient graph nodes and the length of the elimination tree nodes are composed to build an Approximate Minimum Degree and Minimum Length (AMDML) model. The quotient graph node with the minimum degree, which is also the minimum length of elimination tree node, is selected as the next ordering vector. Compared with AMD ordering method and other common methods, the proposed method further reduces the length of elimination tree without increasing the number of nonzero fillings; the length was decreased by about 10\% compared with the AMD method. A testbed for experiment was built. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated based on different sizes of coefficient matrices of power flow cases.},

  abstract    = {Sparsity can be found in the underlying structure of many real-world computationally expensive problems including big graph analytics and large scale sparse deep neural networks. In addition, if gracefully investigated, many of these problems contain a broad substratum of parallelism suitable for parallel and distributed executions of sparse computation. However, usually, dense computation is preferred to its sparse alternative as sparse computation is not only hard to parallelize due to the irregular nature of the sparse data, but also complicated to implement in terms of rewriting a dense algorithm into a sparse one. Hence, foolproof sparse computation requires customized data structures to encode the sparsity of the sparse data and new algorithms to mask the complexity of the sparse computation. However, by carefully exploiting the sparse data structures and algorithms, sparse computation can reduce memory consumption, communication volume, and processing power and thus undoubtedly move the scalability boundaries compared to its dense equivalent.\\ In this dissertation, I explain how to use parallel and distributed computing techniques in the presence of sparsity to solve large scientific problems including graph analytics and deep learning. To meet this end goal, I leverage the duality between graph theory and sparse linear algebra primitives, and thus solve graph analytics and deep learning problems with the sparse matrix operations. My contributions are fourfold: (1) design and implementation of a new distributed compressed sparse matrix data structure that reduces both computation and communication volumes and is suitable for sparse matrix-vector and sparse matrix-matrix operations, (2) introducing the new MPI + X parallelism model that deems threads as basic units of computing and communication, (3) optimizing sparse matrix-matrix multiplication by employing different hashing techniques, and (4) proposing the new data-then-model parallelism that mitigates the effect of stragglers in sparse deep learning by combining data and model parallelisms. Altogether, these contributions provide a set of data structures and algorithms to accelerate and scale the sparse computing and communication.}

For the application in real-time grid operation and in cases when computational time is critical, a novel approach on parallelization of Newton-Raphson power flow for many calculations on CPU and with GPU-acceleration is proposed. The result shows a speed-up of over x100 comparing to the open-source tool pandapower, when performing repetitive power flows of system with admittance matrix of the same sparsity pattern on both CPU and GPU. The speed-up relies on the optimized algorithm and parallelization strategy, which can reduce the repetitive work and saturate the high hardware performance of modern CPUs and GPUs well. This is achieved with the proposed batched sparse matrix operation and batched linear solver based on LU-refactorization. The batched linear solver shows a large performance improvement comparing to the state-of-art linear system solver KLU library and a better saturation of the GPU performance with small problem scale. Finally, the method of integrating the proposed solver into pandapower is presented, thus the parallel power flow solver with outstanding performance can be easily applied in challenging real-life grid operation and innovative researches e.g. data-driven machine learning studies.},

Iterative techniques are typically preferred over direct methods when it comes to large systems due to their lower memory requirements and shorter execution times. Gauss-Seidel (GS) is an iterative method for solving linear systems that are either strictly diagonally dominant or symmetric positive definite. This technique is an improved version of Jacobi and typically converges in fewer iterations. However, the sequential nature of this algorithm complicates the parallel extraction. In fact, most parallel derivatives of GS rely on the sparsity pattern of the coefficient matrix and require matrix reordering or domain decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that exploits the convergence property of GS and adapts the parallel structure of Jacobi. The proposed method works for both dense and sparse systems and is straightforward to implement. We have thoroughly examined the performance of our method on multicore and many-core architectures. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of proposed algorithm compared with GS and Jacobi. Additionally, performance comparison with built-in Krylov solvers in MATLAB showed that in terms of time per iteration, Krylov methods perform faster on CPUs, but our approach is significantly better when executed on GPUs.},

  abstract = {The block version of classical Gram-Schmidt (BCGS) is often employed to efficiently compute orthogonal bases for Krylov subspace methods and eigenvalue solvers, but a rigorous proof of its stability behavior has not yet been established. It is shown that the usual implementation of BCGS can lose orthogonality at a rate worse than $O(\epsilon)\kappa^2(X)$, where $\epsilon$ is the unit round-off. A useful intermediate quantity denoted as the Cholesky residual is given special attention and, along with a block generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, this quantity is used to develop more stable variants of BCGS. These variants are proved to have $O(\epsilon)\kappa^2(X)$ loss of orthogonality with relatively relaxed conditions on the intra-block orthogonalization routine. A variety of numerical examples illustrate the theoretical bounds.}

Our interest lies in solving large-scale sparse symmetric positive definite linear systems of equations where the system matrix is preordered to doubly bordered block diagonal form (for example, using a nested dissection ordering). We investigate the use of randomized methods to construct high quality preconditioners. In particular, we propose a new and efficient approach that employs Nystr\"om's method for computing low rank approximations to develop robust algebraic two-level preconditioners. Construction of the new preconditioners involves iteratively solving a smaller but denser symmetric positive definite Schur complement system with multiple right-hand sides. Numerical experiments on problems coming from a range of application areas demonstrate that this inner system can be solved cheaply using block conjugate gradients and that using a large convergence tolerance to limit the cost does not adversely affect the quality of the resulting Nystr\"om--Schur two-level preconditioner.},

  abstract    = {Fluid simulations are often performed using the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE), leading to sparse linear systems which are difficult to solve efficiently in parallel. Recently, kinetic methods based on the adaptive-central-moment multiple-relaxation-time (ACM-MRT) model have demonstrated impressive capabilities to simulate both laminar and turbulent flows, with quality matching or surpassing that of state-of-the-art INSE solvers. Furthermore, due to its local formulation, this method presents the opportunity for highly scalable implementations on parallel systems such as GPUs. However, an efficient ACM-MRT-based kinetic solver needs to overcome a number of computational challenges, especially when dealing with complex solids inside the fluid domain. In this paper, we present multiple novel GPU optimization techniques to efficiently implement high-quality ACM-MRT-based kinetic fluid simulations in domains containing complex solids. Our techniques include a new communication-efficient data layout, a load-balanced immersed-boundary method, a multi-kernel launch method using a simplified formulation of ACM-MRT calculations to enable greater parallelism, and the integration of these techniques into a parametric cost model to enable automated parameter search to achieve optimal execution performance. We also extended our method to multi-GPU systems to enable large-scale simulations. To demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and high visual quality of our solver, we present extensive experimental results and comparisons to other solvers.},

In this paper, a new algorithm based on the Bat optimization approach is developed for finding the maximum k-clique on a social network to increase the convergence speed and evaluation criteria such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The proposed algorithm is simulated in Matlab® software over Dolphin social network and DIMACS dataset for $k = 3, 4, 5$. The computational results show that the convergence speed on the former dataset is increased in comparison with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approaches. Besides, the evaluation criteria are also modified on the latter dataset and the F1-score is obtained as 100\% for $k = 5$.},

We examine the novel formulations and prove that, under certain assumptions, the relaxations form a hierarchy starting from a big-M equivalent and converging to the convex hull. We computationally compare the proposed formulations to big-M and convex hull formulations on a test set including: K-means clustering, P_ball problems, and ReLU neural networks. The computational results show that the intermediate P-split formulations can form strong outer approximations of the convex hull with fewer variables and constraints than the extended convex hull formulations, giving significant computational advantages over both the big-M and convex hull.},

A popular approach is to formulate the inverse problem as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. The stationary point satisfies a Karush-Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) system consisting of the state, adjoint and source equations which is rather difficult to solve on parallel computers. We propose and study a parallel method that decomposes the optimization problem on the global domain into subproblems on overlapping subdomains, each subdomain is further decomposed to form an additive Schwarz preconditioner for solving these smaller subproblems simultaneously with a preconditioned Krylov subspace method. For each subproblem, the overlapping part of the solution is discarded and the remaining non-overlapping part of the solution is put together to obtain an approximated global solution to the inverse problem. Since all the subproblems are solved independently, the multilevel domain decomposition method has the advantage of higher degree of parallelism. Numerical experiments show that the algorithm is accurate in terms of the reconstruction error and has reasonably good speedup in terms of the total computing time. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach on a parallel computer with more than $1,000$ processors are reported.},

Our proposed algorithm allows us to achieve not only high speed by parallel computing but also high solution accuracy for problems with up to one million binary variables. Benchmarking shows that our machine based on the algorithm achieves high performance compared to recently developed machines, including a quantum annealer using a superconducting circuit, a coherent Ising machine using a laser, and digital processors based on various algorithms. Thus, high-performance combinatorial optimization is realized by massively parallel implementations of the proposed algorithm based on classical mechanics.},

These aspects are not documented by NVIDIA, and we gain insight by running carefully designed numerical experiments on these hardware units. Knowing the answers to these questions is important if one wishes to: (1) accurately simulate NVIDIA tensor cores on conventional hardware; (2) understand the differences between results produced by code that utilizes tensor cores and code that uses only IEEE 754-compliant arithmetic operations; and (3) build custom hardware whose behavior matches that of NVIDIA tensor cores. As part of this work we provide a test suite that can be easily adapted to test newer versions of the NVIDIA tensor cores as well as similar accelerators from other vendors, as they become available.

Consider a dynamic model discrimination setting where we wish to chose: (i) what is the best mechanistic, time-varying model and (ii) what are the best model parameter estimates. These tasks are often termed model discrimination/selection/validation/verification. Typically, several rival mechanistic models can explain data, so we incorporate available data and also run new experiments to gather more data. Design of dynamic experiments for model discrimination helps optimally collect data. For rival mechanistic models where we have access to gradient information, we extend existing methods to incorporate a wider range of problem uncertainty and show that our proposed approach is equivalent to historical approaches when limiting the types of considered uncertainty. We also consider rival mechanistic models as dynamic black boxes that we can evaluate, e.g. by running legacy code, but where gradient or other advanced information is unavailable. We replace these black-box models with Gaussian process surrogate models and thereby extend the model discrimination setting to additionally incorporate rival black-box model. We also explore the consequences of using Gaussian process surrogates to approximate gradient-based methods.},

  abstract    = {Nowadays, GPU accelerators are commonly used to speed up general-purpose computing tasks on a variety of hardware. However, due to the diversity of GPU architectures and processed data, optimization of codes for a particular type of hardware and specific data characteristics can be extremely challenging. The autotuning of performance-relevant source-code parameters allows for automatic optimization of applications and keeps their performance portable. Although the autotuning process typically results in code speed-up, searching the tuning space can bring unacceptable overhead if (i) the tuning space is vast and full of poorly-performing implementations, or (ii) the autotuning process has to be repeated frequently because of changes in processed data or migration to different hardware. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for searching tuning spaces. The method takes advantage of collecting hardware performance counters (also known as profiling counters) during empirical tuning. Those counters are used to navigate the searching process towards faster implementations. The method requires the tuning space to be sampled on any GPU. It builds a problem-specific model, which can be used during autotuning on various, even previously unseen inputs or GPUs. Using a set of five benchmarks, we experimentally demonstrate that our method can speed up autotuning when an application needs to be ported to different hardware or when it needs to process data with different characteristics. We also compared our method to state of the art and show that our method is superior in terms of the number of searching steps and typically outperforms other searches in terms of convergence time.},

The tensors represented real-world data are usually large and sparse. There are tens of storage formats designed for sparse matrices and/or tensors and the performance of sparse tensor operations depends on a particular architecture and/or selected sparse format, which makes it challenging to implement and optimize every tensor operation of interest and transfer the code from one architecture to another. We propose a tensor algebra domain-specific language (DSL) and compiler infrastructure to automatically generate kernels for mixed sparse-dense tensor algebra operations, named COMET. The proposed DSL provides high-level programming abstractions that resemble the familiar Einstein notation to represent tensor algebra operations. The compiler performs code optimizations and transformations for efficient code generation while covering a wide range of tensor storage formats. COMET compiler also leverages data reordering to improve spatial or temporal locality for better performance. Our results show that the performance of automatically generated kernels outperforms the state-of-the-art sparse tensor algebra compiler, with up to 20.92x, 6.39x, and 13.9x performance improvement, for parallel SpMV, SpMM, and TTM over TACO, respectively.},

These algorithms are built upon a new solid theoretical justification that guarantees that the sequence of approximate solutions to each problem in the sequence converges to the solution of the considered modified version of the $\ell_2$-$\ell_1$ problem. Compared to other traditional methods, the new algorithms have the advantage of building a single (flexible) approximation (Krylov) subspace that encodes regularization through variable “preconditioning” and that is expanded as soon as a new problem in the sequence is defined. Links between the new solvers and other well-established solvers based on augmenting Krylov subspaces are also established.

In this paper, we present the first floating-point support in a deductive verification tool for the Java programming language. Our support in the KeY verifier handles arithmetic via floating-point decision procedures inside SMT solvers and transcendental functions via axiomatization. We evaluate this integration on new benchmarks, and show that this approach is powerful enough to prove the absence of floating-point special values -- often a prerequisite for further reasoning about numerical computations -- as well as certain functional properties for realistic benchmarks.},

In this paper, we describe a custom interior-point algorithm for solving FLP with relative positioning constraints (FLPRC) that is much faster than the standard methods used in the general-purpose solver. We build a compact formation of FLPRC and its duals, which enables us to establish the optimal condition very quickly. We use this optimality condition to implement the primal-dual interior-point method with an efficient Newton step computation that exploit special structure of a Hessian. We confirm effectiveness of our proposed model through applications to several well-known benchmark data sets. Our algorithm shows much faster speed for finding the optimal solution.},

  abstract = {Null-space methods have long been used to solve large sparse $n \times n$ symmetric saddle point systems of equations in which the $(2, 2)$ block is zero. This paper focuses on the case where the $(1, 1)$ block is ill conditioned or rank deficient and the $k \times k$ $(2, 2)$ block is non zero and small $(k \ll n)$. Such systems arise in a range of practical applications, including sparse-dense linear least squares problems. A novel null-space approach is proposed that transforms the system matrix into a nicer symmetric saddle point matrix of order $n$ that has a non zero $(2, 2)$ block of order at most $2k$ and, importantly, the $(1, 1)$ block is positive definite. Success of any null-space approach depends on constructing a suitable null-space basis. We propose new methods for constructing such bases for wide matrices that have far fewer rows than columns with the aim of balancing stability of the transformed saddle point matrix with preserving sparsity in the $(1, 1)$ block. Linear least squares problems that contain a small number of dense rows are used to illustrate our ideas and to explore their potential for solving large-scale systems.}

  abstract    = {MPI derived datatypes are an abstraction that simplifies handling of non-contiguous data in MPI applications. These datatypes are recursively constructed at runtime from primitive Named Types defined in the MPI standard. More recently, the development and deployment of CUDA-aware MPI implementations has encouraged the transition of distributed high-performance MPI codes to use GPUs. Such implementations allow MPI functions to directly operate on GPU buffers, easing integration of GPU compute into MPI codes. Despite substantial attention to CUDA-aware MPI implementations, they continue to offer cripplingly poor GPU performance when manipulating derived datatypes on GPUs. This work presents a new MPI library, TEMPI, to address this issue. TEMPI first introduces a common datatype to represent equivalent MPI derived datatypes. TEMPI can be used as an interposed library on existing MPI deployments without system or application changes. Furthermore, this work presents a performance model of GPU derived datatype handling, demonstrating that previously preferred "one-shot" methods are not always fastest. Ultimately, the interposed-library model of this work demonstrates MPI_Pack speedup of up to 242,000x and MPI_Send speedup of up to 59,000x compared to the MPI implementation deployed on a leadership-class supercomputer. This yields speedup of more than 1000x in a 3D halo exchange at 192 ranks.},

  abstract    = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an essential element in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Asynchronous parallel shared-memory SGD (AsyncSGD), including synchronization-free algorithms, e.g. HOGWILD!, have received interest in certain contexts, due to reduced overhead compared to synchronous parallelization. Despite that they induce staleness and inconsistency, they have shown speedup for problems satisfying smooth, strongly convex targets, and gradient sparsity. Recent works take important steps towards understanding the potential of parallel SGD for problems not conforming to these strong assumptions, in particular for deep learning (DL). There is however a gap in current literature in understanding when AsyncSGD algorithms are useful in practice, and in particular how mechanisms for synchronization and consistency play a role. We focus on the impact of consistency-preserving non-blocking synchronization in SGD convergence, and in sensitivity to hyper-parameter tuning. We propose Leashed-SGD, an extensible algorithmic framework of consistency-preserving implementations of AsyncSGD, employing lock-free synchronization, effectively balancing throughput and latency. We argue analytically about the dynamics of the algorithms, memory consumption, the threads' progress over time, and the expected contention. We provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation, validating the analytical claims, benchmarking the proposed Leashed-SGD framework, and comparing to baselines for training multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We observe the crucial impact of contention, staleness and consistency and show how Leashed-SGD provides significant improvements in stability as well as wall-clock time to convergence (from 20-80\% up to 4x improvements) compared to the standard lock-based AsyncSGD algorithm and HOGWILD!, while reducing the overall memory footprint.},

In this paper, we present techniques for implementing this type of preconditioner on General-purpose computing on GPU (GPGPU) using OpenACC. Our implementation is designed for 3-dimensional finite-difference computations with 7-point stencil, and the matrix storage format is optimized to realize coalesced memory access. Also, mixed-precision computation is employed to exploit the high single-precision performance of GPUs without sacrificing the accuracy of the computed solution. Extensive numerical tests were performed and the optimal values of various tunable parameters such as the number of blocks in each direction and the number of workers specified in OpenACC clauses are discussed. Performance comparison on NVIDIA Quadro GP100 and Tesla K40t GPUs shows that our solver is much faster than existing libraries like cuSPARSE, MAGMA, ViennaCL, and Ginkgo, especially when multiple linear equations with coefficient matrices sharing the same nonzero pattern are solved.},

We build upon the algorithm, spaQR (sparsified QR), that was developed by the authors to solve large sparse linear systems. Our algorithm is built on top of a Nested Dissection based multifrontal QR approach. We use low-rank approximations on the frontal matrices to sparsify the vertex separators at every level in the elimination tree. Using a two-step sparsification scheme, we reduce the number of columns and maintain the ratio of rows to columns in each front without introducing any additional fill-in. With this improvised scheme, we show that the runtime of the algorithm scales as $\mathcal{O}(M \log N)$ and uses $\mathcal{O}(M)$ memory to store the factorization. This is achieved at the expense of a small and controllable approximation error. The end result is an approximate factorization of the matrix stored as a sequence of sparse orthogonal and upper-triangular factors and hence easy to apply/solve with a vector. Finally, we compare the performance of the spaQR algorithm in solving sparse least squares problems with direct multifrontal QR and CGLS iterative method with a standard diagonal preconditioner.},

It consists of computing gradients of a smoothed approximation of the objective function (and constraints), and employing them within established codes. These gradient approximations are calculated by finite differences, with a differencing interval determined by the noise level in the functions and a bound on the second or third derivatives. It is assumed that noise level is known or can be estimated by means of difference tables or sampling. The use of finite differences has been largely dismissed in the derivative-free optimization literature as too expensive in terms of function evaluations and/or as impractical when the objective function contains noise. The test results presented in this paper suggest that such views should be re-examined and that the finite-difference approach has much to be recommended. The tests compared NEWUOA, DFO-LS and COBYLA against the finite-difference approach on three classes of problems: general unconstrained problems, nonlinear least squares, and general nonlinear programs with equality constraints.},

Some faults are benign, but others can lead to silent data corruption (SDC), which represents a serious problem; a fault introducing an error that is not readily detected nto an HPC simulation. Due to the insidious nature of SDCs, researchers have worked to understand their impact on applications. Previous studies have relied on expensive fault injection campaigns with uniform sampling to provide overall SDC rates, but this solution does not provide any feedback on the code regions without samples.\\ In this research, we develop a method to systematically analyze all fault injection sites in an application with a low number of fault injection experiments. We use fault propagation data from a fault injection experiment to predict the resiliency of other untested fault sites and obtain an approximate fault tolerance threshold value for each site, which represents the largest error that can be introduced at the site without incurring incorrect simulation results. We define the collection of threshold values over all fault sites in the program as a fault tolerance boundary and propose a simple but efficient method to approximate the boundary. In our experiments, we show our method reduces the number of fault injection samples required to understand a program's resiliency by several orders of magnitude when compared with a traditional fault injection study.}

We also introduce an adaptive variant of restarts which yields improved performance on global optimization problems. As Py-BOBYQA is a model-based trust-region method, we compare largely with other global optimization methods for which (global) models are important, such as Bayesian optimization and response surface methods; we also consider state-of-the-art representative deterministic and stochastic codes, such as DIRECT and CMA-ES. We find numerically that the restarts procedures in Py-BOBYQA are effective at helping it to escape local minima, when compared to using no restarts in Py-BOBYQA. Additionally, we find that Py-BOBYQA with adaptive restarts has comparable performance with global optimization solvers for all accuracy/budget regimes, in both smooth and noisy settings. In particular, Py-BOBYQA variants are best performing for smooth and multiplicative noise problems in high-accuracy regimes. As a by-product, some preliminary conclusions can be drawn on the relative performance of the global solvers we have tested with default settings.},

  abstract  = {This work examines a data-intensive irregular application from genomics, a long-read to long-read alignment problem, which represents a kind of Generalized N-Body problem, one of the "seven giants" of the NRC Big Data motifs [5]. In this problem, computations (genomic alignments) are performed on sparse and data-dependent pairs of inputs, with variable cost computation and variable datum sizes. In particular, there is no inherent locality in the pairwise interactions, unlike simulation-based N-Body problems, and the interaction sparsity depends on particular parameters of the input, which can also affect the quality of the output. We examine two extremes to distributed memory parallelization for this problem, bulk-synchrony and asynchrony, with real workloads. Our bulk-synchronous implementation, uses collective communication in MPI, while our asynchronous implementation uses cross-node RPCs in UPC++. We show that the asynchronous version effectively hides communication costs, with a memory footprint that is typically much lower than the bulk-synchronous version. Our application, while simple enough to be a kind of proxy for genomics or data analytics applications more broadly, is also part of a real application pipeline. It shows good scaling on real input problems, and at the same time, reveals some of the programming and architectural challenges for scaling this type of data-intensive irregular application.}

Although researchers want to use distributed systems for training, it has been reported that the communication cost for synchronizing gradients can be a bottleneck.

In this work, we propose Auto Precision Scaling (APS), an algorithm that can improve the accuracy when we communicate gradients by low-precision floating-point values. APS can improve the accuracy for all precisions with a trivial communication cost. Our experimental results show that for both image classification and segmentation, applying APS can train the state-of-the-art models by 8-bit floating-point gradients with no or only a tiny accuracy loss (<0.05\%). Furthermore, we can avoid any accuracy loss by designing a hybrid-precision technique. Finally, we propose a performance model to evaluate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that APS can get a significant speedup over the state-of-the-art method. To make it available to researchers and developers, we design and implement a high-performance system for customized precision Deep Learning(CPD), which can simulate the training process using an arbitrary low-precision customized floating-point format. We integrate CPD into PyTorch and make it open-source to the public.}

By exploiting the matrix adjugate and applying various matrix norm bounds from the literature we derive bounds on the condition numbers for the two cases and we compare them with the optimal condition numbers found by exhaustive search. We also investigate the existence of factorizations $W = Z^T Z$ with $Z$ having integer or rational entries. Drawing on recent research that links the existence of these factorizations to number-theoretic considerations of quadratic forms, we show that $W$ has an integer factor $Z$ and two rational factors, up to signed permutations.

However, real-world sparse tensors are challenging to process due to their irregular shapes and data distributions. We propose the Adaptive Linearized Tensor Order (ALTO) format, a novel mode-agnostic (general) representation that keeps neighboring nonzero elements in the multi-dimensional space close to each other in memory. To generate the indexing metadata, ALTO uses an adaptive bit encoding scheme that trades off index computations for lower memory usage and more effective use of memory bandwidth. Moreover, by decoupling its sparse representation from the irregular spatial distribution of nonzero elements, ALTO eliminates the workload imbalance and greatly reduces the synchronization overhead of tensor computations. As a result, the parallel performance of ALTO-based tensor operations becomes a function of their inherent data reuse. On a gamut of tensor datasets, ALTO outperforms an oracle that selects the best state-of-the-art format for each dataset, when used in key tensor decomposition operations. Specifically, ALTO achieves a geometric mean speedup of 8X over the best mode-agnostic format, while delivering a geometric mean compression ratio of more than 4X relative to the best mode-specific format.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a comparison of the numerical aspect and efficiency of several low rank approximation techniques for multidimensional data, namely CPD, HOSVD, TT-SVD, RPOD, QTT-SVD and HT. This approach is different from the numerous papers that compare the theoretical aspects of these methods or propose efficient implementation of a single technique. Here, after a brief presentation of the studied methods, they are tested in practical conditions in order to draw hindsight at which one should be preferred. Synthetic data provides sufficient evidence for dismissing CPD, T-HOSVD and RPOD. Then, three examples from mechanics provide data for realistic application of TT-SVD and ST-HOSVD. The obtained low rank approximation provides different levels of compression and accuracy depending on how separable the data is. In all cases, the data layout has significant influence on the analysis of modes and computing time while remaining similarly efficient at compressing information. Both methods provide satisfactory compression, from 0.1\% to 20\% of the original size within a few percent error in $L^2$ norm. ST-HOSVD provides an orthonormal basis while TT-SVD doesn’t. QTT is performing well only when one dimension is very large. A final experiment is applied to an order 7 tensor with ($4 \times 8 \times 8 \times 64 \times 64 \times 64 \times 64$) entries (32 GB) from complex multi-physics experiment. In that case, only HT provides actual compression (50\%) due to the low separability of this data. However, it is better suited for higher order d. Finally, these numerical tests have been performed with pydecomp , an open source python library developed by the author.},

  abstract     = {The multi-block linearly constrained separable convex optimization is frequently applied in numerous applications, including image/signal processing, statistical learning, and data mining, where the objective function is the sum of multiple individual convex functions, and the key constraints are linear. A classical approach to solving such optimization problem could be the alternating direction method of multipliers(ADMM). It decomposes the subproblem into a series of small-scale ones such that its per-iteration cost may be meager. ADMM, however, is designed initially for the two-block model, and its convergence can not be guaranteed for a general multi-block model without additional assumptions. Dai et al. (2017) proposed the algorithm SUSLM (for Sequential Updating Scheme of the Lagrange Multiplier) for separable convex programming problems. The Lagrange multipliers are updated several times at each iteration, and a correction step is imposed at the end of each iteration. In order to derive its convergence property, a correction step is imposed at the end of each iteration. In this paper, we improve the SUSLM algorithm by introducing two controlled parameters in the updating expressions for decision variables and Lagrange multipliers. The condition of step sizes is then relaxed. We show experimentally that our SUSLM algorithm converges faster than SUSLM. Moreover, result comparisons on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) show better performances than other ADMM-based algorithms.},

This framework is specialized to nonlinear least-squares problems, with a model-based framework based on the Gauss-Newton method. This method achieves scalability by constructing local linear interpolation models to approximate the Jacobian, and computes new steps at each iteration in a subspace with user-determined dimension. We then describe a practical implementation of this framework, which we call DFBGN. We outline efficient techniques for selecting the interpolation points and search subspace, yielding an implementation that has a low per-iteration linear algebra cost (linear in the problem dimension) while also achieving fast objective decrease as measured by evaluations. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that DFBGN has improved scalability, yielding strong performance on large-scale nonlinear least-squares problems.},

  abstract     = {In engineering practice, most design criteria require time-consuming functional evaluation. To tackle such design problems, multiobjective Bayesian optimization has been widely applied to generation of optimal Pareto solutions. However, improvement function-based expected improvement (EI) and the hypervolume improvement-based lower confidence bound (LCB) infill-criteria are frequently criticized for their high computational cost. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel approach for developing multiobjective LCB criteria on the basis of LCB improvement matrix. Specifically, three cheap yet efficient infill-criteria are suggested by introducing three different improvement functions (namely, hypervolume improvement, Euclidean distance and maximin distance) that assemble the improvement matrix to a scalar value, which is then maximized for adding solution points sequentially. All these criteria have closed-form expressions and can maintain the anticipated properties, thereby largely reducing computational efforts without either integration or expensive evaluation of hypervolume indicator. The efficiency of the proposed criteria is demonstrated through the ZDT and DTLZ tests with different numbers of design variables and different complexities of objectives. The testing results exhibit that the proposed criteria have faster convergence, and enable to generate satisfactory Pareto front with fairly low computational cost compared with other conventional criteria. Finally, the best performing criterion is further applied to real-life design problems of tailor rolled blank (TRB) thin-walled structures under impact loads, which demonstrates a strong search capability for with good distribution of Pareto points, potentially providing an effective means to engineering design with strong nonlinearity and sophistication.},

The nuclear-norm based methods possess satisfactory recovery performance, while they suffer from high computational cost and usually have slow convergence rate. In this paper, we propose two new iterative algorithms for solving the nuclear-norm regularization based graph signal matrix completion (NRGSMC) problem. By adopting approximate diagonalization approaches to estimate singular value decomposition (SVD), we obtain two generalized Newton algorithms, the generalized Newton with truncated Jacobi method (GNTJM) and the generalized Newton with parallel truncated Jacobi method (GNPTJM). The proposed methods are with low complexity and fast convergence by using the second-order information associated with the problem. Numerical results on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our schemes have evidently faster convergence rate than the gradient method with exact SVD, while maintain the similar completion performance.},

Both steady-state and time-dependent problems are considered. First of all, space-fractional derivatives defined in Riemann–Liouville sense are discretized by using the weighted average of shifted Grünwald formula, which results in a fully dense and nonsymmetric linear system for the steady-state problem, or a semi-discretized ODE system for the time-dependent problem. Then, to solve the former problem, we propose the EXCMG method with the biconjugate gradient stabilized smoother to deal with the dense and nonsymmetric linear system. Next, such technique is extended to solve the latter problem since it becomes fully discrete when the Crank-Nicolson scheme is introduced to handle the temporal derivative. Finally, several numerical examples are reported to show that the EXCMG method is an efficient solver for both steady-state and time-dependent SFDEs, and performs much better than the V-cycle multigrid method with banded-splitting smoother for time-dependent SFDEs [Lin et al.

In this article, we present a parallel SpMM${}^T$V algorithm for shared‐memory CPUs.

This sparse matrix format can be also used for SpMV, SpM${}^T$V, and similar sparse matrix‐vector operations. We expand upon existing research by suggesting new variants of the parallel SpMM${}^T$V algorithm and by extending the algorithm to efficiently support symmetric matrices. We compare the performance of the presented parallel SpMM${}^T$V algorithm with alternative approaches, which use state‐of‐the‐art sparse matrix formats and libraries, using sparse matrices from real‐world applications. The performance results indicate that the median performance of our proposed parallel SpMM${}^T$V algorithm is up to 45\% higher than of the alternative approaches.},

Desired graphs should have two characteristics: 1) they should be able to well-capture the underlying structures of the data sets. 2) they should be sparse enough so that the downstream algorithms can be performed efficiently on them.\\ This dissertation first studies the application of a two-phase spectrum-preserving spectral sparsification method that enables to construct very sparse sparsifiers with guaranteed preservation of original graph spectra for spectral clustering. Experiments show that the computational challenge due to the eigen-decomposition procedure in spectral clustering can be fundamentally addressed.\\ We then propose a highly-scalable spectral graph learning approach GRASPEL (Graph Spectral Learning at Scale). GRASPEL can learn high-quality graphs from high dimensional input data. Compared with prior state-of-the-art graph learning and construction methods [26, 27, 38] , GRASPEL leads to substantially improved algorithm performance.}

In this context, convex optimisation theory offers modern algorithmic structures that can handle extreme data volumes by distributing the computation across large computer systems, while explicitly incorporating complex image prior models to regularise the problem. Motivated by these advantages, we introduce a C++ library and set of applications, dubbed Puri-Psi, as a production implementation of the recently proposed RI imaging approach HyperSARA, previously available as a proof-of-concept MATLAB implementation. Puri-Psi enables scaling up to very large data volumes by parallelising across a large number processes and compute nodes. We validate Puri-Psi against the MATLAB implementation, and evaluate its performance in a representative high performance computing setting.},

Sparse direct supernodal approaches are one these techniques. However, despite providing a very good scalability and reducing the memory footprint, they suffer from an important flops overhead in their unstructured low-rank updates. As a consequence, the execution time is not improved as expected. In this paper, we study a solution to improve low-rank compression techniques in sparse supernodal solvers. The proposed method tackles the overprice of the low-rank updates by identifying the blocks that have poor compression rates. We show that block incomplete LU factorization, thanks to the block fill-in levels, allows to identify most of these non-compressible blocks at low cost. This identification enables to postpone the low-rank compression step to trade small extra memory consumption for a better time to solution. The solution is validated within the PaStiX library with a large set of application matrices. It demonstrates sequential and multi-threaded speedup up to 8.5$\times$, for small memory overhead of less than 1.49$\times$ with respect to the original version.}

Well-documented computing roadblocks in the analysis of large geospatial datasets using Gaussian Processes have now been successfully mitigated via several recent statistical innovations. Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes (NNGP) has emerged as one of the leading candidates for such massive-scale geospatial analysis owing to their empirical success. This article reviews the connection of NNGP to sparse Cholesky factors of the spatial precision (inverse-covariance) matrices. Focus of the review is on these sparse Cholesky matrices which are versatile and have recently found many diverse applications beyond the primary usage of NNGP for fast parameter estimation and prediction in the spatial (generalized) linear models. In particular, we discuss applications of sparse NNGP Cholesky matrices to address multifaceted computational issues in spatial bootstrapping, simulation of large-scale realizations of Gaussian random fields, and extensions to non-parametric mean function estimation of a Gaussian Process using Random Forests. We also review a sparse-Cholesky-based model for areal (geographically-aggregated) data that addresses interpretability issues of existing areal models. Finally, we highlight some yet-to-be-addressed issues of such sparse Cholesky approximations that warrants further research.},

For the primal-dual formulation of this problem, we propose a novel algorithm called \emph{Variance Reduction via Primal-Dual Accelerated Dual Averaging (VRPDA)}. In the nonsmooth and general convex setting, VRPDA~has the overall complexity $O(nd\log\min \{1/\epsilon, n\} + d/\epsilon )$ in terms of the primal-dual gap, where $n$ denotes the number of samples, $d$ the dimension of the primal variables, and $\epsilon$ the desired accuracy. In the nonsmooth and strongly convex setting, the overall complexity of VRPDA~becomes $O(nd\log\min\{1/\epsilon, n\} + d/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ in terms of both the primal-dual gap and the distance between iterate and optimal solution. Both these results for VRPDA~improve significantly on state-of-the-art complexity estimates, which are $O(nd\log \min\{1/\epsilon, n\} + \sqrt{n}d/\epsilon)$ for the nonsmooth and general convex setting and $O(nd\log \min\{1/\epsilon, n\} + \sqrt{n}d/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ for the nonsmooth and strongly convex setting, in a much more simple and straightforward way. Moreover, both complexities are better than \emph{lower} bounds for general convex finite sums that lack the particular (common) structure that we consider. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which confirm the competitive performance of VRPDA~compared to state-of-the-art.},

  abstract     = {Duplication with Comparison (DWC) is an effective software-level solution to improve the reliability of computing devices. However, it introduces significant performance and energy consumption overheads that could render the protected application unsuitable for high-performance computing or real-time safety-critical applications. Modern computing architectures offer the possibility to execute operations in various precisions, and recent NVIDIA GPUs even feature dedicated functional units for computing with programmable accuracy. In this work, we propose Reduced-Precision Duplication with Comparison (RP-DWC) as a means to leverage the available mixed-precision hardware resources to implement software-level fault detection with reduced overheads. We discuss the benefits and challenges associated with RP-DWC and show that the intrinsic difference between the mixed-precision copies allows for the detection of most, but not all, errors. However, as the undetected faults are the ones that fall into the difference between precisions, they are the ones that produce a much smaller impact in the application output. We investigate, through fault injection and beam experiment campaigns, using three microbenchmarks and two real applications on Volta GPUs, RP-DWC impact into fault detection, performance, and energy consumption. We show that RP-DWC achieves an excellent coverage (up to 86\%) with minimal overheads (0.1\% time and 24\% energy consumption overhead).},

However, the lack of synchronization barriers in asynchronous processing brings challenges for continuous processing while workers might fail. There is no global synchronization point that all workers can roll back to. In this article, we propose a fault-tolerant framework for asynchronous iterative computations (FAIC). Our framework takes a virtual snapshot of the AIC system without halting the computation of any worker. We prove that the virtual snapshot capture by FAIC can recover the AIC system correctly. We evaluate our FAIC framework on two existing AIC systems, Maiter and NOMAD. Our experiment result shows that the checkpoint overhead of FAIC is more than 50 percent shorter than the synchronous checkpoint method. FAIC is around 10 percent faster than other asynchronous snapshot algorithms, such as the Chandy-Lamport algorithm. Our experiments on a large cluster demonstrate that FAIC scales with the number of workers.},

We investigate the use of direct-search methods that belong to a class of derivative-free techniques that only access the objective function through an oracle. In this work, we design a novel algorithm in the context of min-max saddle point games where one sequentially updates the min and the max player. We prove convergence of this algorithm under mild assumptions, where the objective of the max-player satisfies the Polyak-\L{}ojasiewicz (PL) condition, while the min-player is characterized by a nonconvex objective. Our method only assumes dynamically adjusted accurate estimates of the oracle with a fixed probability. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first one to address the convergence of a direct-search method for min-max objectives in a stochastic setting.},

We focus on the computation of dense hierarchies and regions with graph nuclei---a generalization of k-cores and trusses. Static computation of nuclei, namely through variants of 'peeling', are easy to understand and implement. However, many practically important graphs undergo continuous change. Dynamic algorithms, maintaining nucleus computations on dynamic graph streams, are nuanced and require significant effort to port between nuclei, e.g., from k-cores to trusses.

We propose a unifying framework to maintain nuclei in dynamic graph streams. First, we show no dynamic algorithm can asymptotically beat re-computation, highlighting the need to experimentally understand variability. Next, we prove equivalence between k-cores on a special hypergraph and nuclei. Our algorithm splits the problem into maintaining the special hypergraph and maintaining k-cores on it. We implement our algorithm and experimentally demonstrate improvements up to 108 x over re-computation. We show algorithmic improvements on k-cores apply to trusses and outperform truss-specific implementations.}

These rational matrix functions are designed so that directions associated with non-sought eigenvalues are dampened to (approximately) zero. Variants based on matrix partitionings are introduced to further reduce the overall complexity of the proposed framework. Compared with existing eigenvalue solvers based on rational matrix functions, the proposed technique requires no estimation of the number of eigenvalues located inside the disk. Several theoretical and practical issues are discussed, and the competitiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via numerical experiments.},

When LBM is advanced with GPUs on complex domains, typically, geometric data is accessed indirectly, and lattice data is accessed lexicographically. Although there are a variety of other access patterns, no study has yet examined the relative efficacy between them. Here, we examine a suite of memory access schemes via empirical testing and performance modeling. We find strong evidence that semi-direct is often better suited than the more common indirect addressing: semi-direct methods provide increased computational speed and may reduce memory consumption. For the lattice layout, we find that the Collected Structure of Arrays (CSoA) and bundling layouts outperform the common Structrure of Array layout; on V100 and P100 devices, CSoA consistently outperforms bundling, however the relationship is more complicated on K40 devices. When compared to state-of-the-art practices, our recommended addressing modifications lead to performance gains between 10--40\% across different domains and reduce memory consumption by as much as 17\%. We demonstrate that our results hold across multiple GPUs on a leadership class system, and present the first near-optimal strong results for LBM with arterial geometries run on GPUs.},

In particular, we prove convergence of TOS with nonasymptotic bounds on its nonstationarity and infeasibility errors.

We also extend our results to a stochastic setting where we have access only to an unbiased estimator of the gradient.

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {Stochastically controlled stochastic gradient (SCSG) methods have been proved to converge efficiently to first-order stationary points which, however, can be saddle points in nonconvex optimization. It has been observed that a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) step introduces anistropic noise around saddle points for deep learning and non-convex half space learning problems, which indicates that SGD satisfies the correlated negative curvature (CNC) condition for these problems. Therefore, we propose to use a separate SGD step to help the SCSG method escape from strict saddle points, resulting in the CNC-SCSG method. The SGD step plays a role similar to noise injection but is more stable. We prove that the resultant algorithm converges to a second-order stationary point with a convergence rate of $\tilde{O}( \epsilon^{-2} log( 1/\epsilon))$ where $\epsilon$ is the pre-specified error tolerance. This convergence rate is independent of the problem dimension, and is faster than that of CNC-SGD. A more general framework is further designed to incorporate the proposed CNC-SCSG into any first-order method for the method to escape saddle points. Simulation studies illustrate that the proposed algorithm can escape saddle points in much fewer epochs than the gradient descent methods perturbed by either noise injection or a SGD step.},

We further show lower bounds for randomized algorithms and compare them with the best known upper bounds. To address some gaps between the bounds, we propose a new second-order smoothness assumption that can be seen as an analogue of the first-order mean-squared smoothness assumption.

Depending on what is obtained, they change more or less data types and repeat the process. Our technique is radically different. Based on semantic equations, we generate an Integer Linear Problem (ILP) from the program source code. Basically, this is done by reasoning on the most significant bit and the number of significant bits of the values which are integer quantities. The integer solution to this problem, computed in polynomial time by a (real) linear programming solver, gives the optimal data types at the bit level. A finer set of semantic equations is also proposed which does not reduce directly to an ILP problem. So we use policy iteration to find the solution. Both techniques have been implemented and we show that our results encompass the results of state of the art tools.},

Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23\% accuracy improvement over the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.},

It reduces thread divergence by reordering and blocking rows of the input matrix with nearly equal number of non-zero elements onto the same execution units (i.e., warps). BRC improves load balance by partitioning rows into blocks with a constant number of non-zeros such that different warps perform the same amount of work. We also present an approach to optimize BRC performance by judicious selection of block size based on sparsity characteristics of the matrix.\\ A CUDA implementation of BRC outperforms NVIDIA CUSP and cuSPARSE libraries and other state-of-the-art SpMV formats on a range of unstructured sparse matrices from multiple application domains. The BRC format has been integrated with PETSc, enabling its use in PETSc’s solvers. Furthermore, when partitioning the input matrix, BRC achieves near linear speedup on multiple GPUs.},

  abstract  = {Solving partial differential equations on unstructured grids is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific computing. Nowadays, heterogeneous parallel platforms with CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs enable energy-efficient and computationally demanding simulations. We developed the HighPerMeshes C++-embedded Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for bridging the abstraction gap between the mathematical and algorithmic formulation of mesh-based algorithms for PDE problems on the one hand and an increasing number of heterogeneous platforms with their different parallel programming and runtime models on the other hand. Thus, the HighPerMeshes DSL aims at higher productivity in the code development process for multiple target platforms. We introduce the concepts as well as the basic structure of the HighPerMeshes DSL, and demonstrate its usage with three examples, a Poisson and monodomain problem, respectively, solved by the continuous finite element method, and the discontinuous Galerkin method for Maxwell’s equation. The mapping of the abstract algorithmic description onto parallel hardware, including distributed memory compute clusters, is presented. Finally, the achievable performance and scalability are demonstrated for a typical example problem on a multi-core CPU cluster.}

  abstract    = {Compared to the classical Lanczos algorithm, the $s$-step Lanczos variant has the potential to improve performance by asymptotically decreasing the synchronization cost per iteration. However, this comes at a cost. Despite being mathematically equivalent, the $s$-step variant is known to behave quite differently in finite precision, with potential for greater loss of accuracy and a decrease in the convergence rate relative to the classical algorithm. It has previously been shown that the errors that occur in the $s$-step version follow the same structure as the errors in the classical algorithm, but with the addition of an amplification factor that depends on the square of the condition number of the $O(s)-$dimensional Krylov bases computed in each outer loop. As the condition number of these $s$-step bases grows (in some cases very quickly) with $s$, this limits the parameter $s$ that can be chosen and thus limits the performance that can be achieved. In this work we show that if a select few computations in $s$-step Lanczos are performed in double the working precision, the error terms then depend only linearly on the conditioning of the $s$-step bases. This has the potential for drastically improving the numerical behavior of the algorithm with little impact on per-iteration performance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the improved numerical behavior possible with the mixed precision approach, and also show that this improved behavior extends to the $s$-step CG algorithm in mixed precision.},

Such a simple principle allows to solve a large class of optimization problems, even nonconvex, nonsmooth and stochastic. We present a stochastic higher-order algorithmic framework for minimizing the average of a very large number of sufficiently smooth functions. Our stochastic framework is based on the notion of stochastic higher-order upper bound approximations of the finite-sum objective function and minibatching. We present convergence guarantees for nonconvex and convex optimization when the higher-order upper bounds approximate the objective function up to an error that is p times differentiable and has a Lipschitz continuous p derivative. More precisely, we derive asymptotic stationary point guarantees for nonconvex problems, and for convex ones we establish local linear convergence results, provided that the objective function is uniformly convex. Unlike other higher-order methods, ours work with any batch size. Moreover, in contrast to most existing stochastic Newton and third-order methods, our approach guarantees local convergence faster than with first-order oracle and adapts to the problem's curvature. Numerical simulations also confirm the efficiency of our algorithmic framework.},

As an alternative approach, this paper presents a fast first-order optimization method. Specifically, we propose an accelerated proximal gradient method for solving a minimization problem of the total potential energy. This algorithm is easy to implement, and free from numerical solution of linear equations.

Under this paradigm, we derive a general site-based approach to approximate inference, whereby we approximate the non-Gaussian likelihood with local Gaussian terms, called sites. Our approach results in a suite of novel sparse extensions to algorithms from both the machine learning and signal processing literature, including variational inference, expectation propagation, and the classical nonlinear Kalman smoothers.

Tasks such as comparing, searching, and summarizing structures, are difficult due to the enormous number of calculations required. For time-varying graphs, the temporal dimension even intensifies the difficulty. In this article, we propose to reduce the complexity of analysis by focusing on subgraphs that are induced by closely related entities. To summarize the diverse structures of subgraphs, we build a supervised layout-based classification model. The main premise is that the graph structures can induce a unique appearance of the layout. In contrast to traditional graph theory-based and contemporary neural network-based methods of graph classification, our approach generates low costs and there is no need to learn informative graph representations. Combined with temporally stable visualizations, we can also facilitate the understanding of sub-structures and the tracking of graph evolution. The method is evaluated on two real-world datasets. The results show that our system is highly effective in carrying out visual-based analytics of large graphs.},

It computes the hash codes from the eigenvectors of the matrix representing the similarities between data points and anchor points; anchors refer to the points representing the data distribution. In performing an approximate nearest neighbor search, the hash codes of a query data point are determined by identifying its closest anchor points. Anchor graph hashing, however, incurs high computation cost since (1) the computation cost of obtaining the eigenvectors is quadratic to the number of anchor points, and (2) the similarities of the query data point to all the anchor points must be computed. Our proposal, Tridiagonal hashing, increases the efciency of anchor graph hashing because of its two advances: (1) we apply a graph clustering algorithm to compute the eigenvectors from the tridiagonal matrix obtained from the similarities between data points and anchor points, and (2) we detect anchor points closest to the query data point by using a dimensionality reduction approach. Experiments show that our approach is several orders of magnitude faster than the previous approaches. Besides, it yields high search accuracy than the original anchor graph hashing approach.},

  abstract    = {Inspired by a second-order primal-dual dynamical system [Zeng X, Lei J, Chen J. Dynamical primal-dual accelerated method with applications to network optimization. 2019; arXiv:1912.03690], we propose an inertial primal-dual method for the linear equality constrained convex optimization problem. When the objective function has a "nonsmooth + smooth" composite structure, we further propose an inexact inertial primal-dual method by linearizing the smooth individual function and solving the subproblem inexactly. Assuming merely convexity, we prove that the proposed methods enjoy $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ convergence rate on $\mathcal{L}(x_k,\lambda^*)-\mathcal{L}(x^*,\lambda^*)$ and $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate on primal feasibility, where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian function and $(x^*,\lambda^*)$ is a saddle point of $\mathcal{L}$. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods.},

  abstract    = {Increasing data volumes in scientific experiments necessitate the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources for data analysis. In many scientific fields, the data generated from scientific instruments and supercomputer simulations must be analyzed rapidly. In fact, the requirement for quasi-instant feedback is growing. Scientists want to use results from one experiment to guide the selection of the next or even to improve the course of a single experiment. Current HPC systems are typically batch-scheduled under policies in which an arriving job is run immediately only if enough resources are available; otherwise, it is queued. It is hard for these systems to support real-time jobs. Real-time jobs, in order to meet their requirements, should sometimes have to preempt batch jobs and/or be scheduled ahead of batch jobs that were submitted earlier. Accommodating real-time jobs may negatively impact system utilization also, especially when preemption/restart of batch jobs is involved. We first explore several existing scheduling strategies to make real-time jobs more likely to be scheduled in due time. We then rigorously formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming for offline scheduling and develop novel scheduling heuristics for online scheduling. We perform simulation studies using trace logs of Mira, the IBM BG/Q system at Argonne National Laboratory, to quantify the impact of real-time jobs on batch job performance for various percentages of real-time jobs in the workload. We present new insights gained from grouping jobs into different categories based on runtime and the number of nodes used and studying the performance of each category. Our results show that with 10\% real-time job percentages, just-in-time checkpointing combined with our heuristic can improve the slowdowns of real-time jobs by 35\% while limiting the increase of the slowdowns of batch jobs to 10\%.},

  abstract  = {High-Performance Computing (HPC) is one of the strategic priorities for research and innovation worldwide due to its relevance for industrial and scientific applications. We envision HPC as composed of three pillars: infrastructures, applications, and key technologies and tools. While infrastructures are by construction centralized in large-scale HPC centers, and applications are generally within the purview of domain-specific organizations, key technologies fall in an intermediate case where coordination is needed, but design and development are often decentralized. A large group of Italian researchers has started a dedicated laboratory within the National Interuniversity Consortium for Informatics (CINI) to address this challenge. The laboratory, albeit young, has managed to succeed in its first attempts to propose a coordinated approach to HPC research within the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, participating in the calls 2019-20 to five successful proposals for an aggregate total cost of 95M Euro. In this paper, we outline the working group's scope and goals and provide an overview of the five funded projects, which become fully operational in March 2021, and cover a selection of key technologies provided by the working group partners, highlighting their usage development within the projects.}

  abstract     = {The Rotation Forest classifier is a successful ensemble method for a wide variety of data mining applications. However, the way in which Rotation Forest transforms the feature space through PCA, although powerful, penalizes training and prediction times, making it unfeasible for Big Data. In this paper, a MapReduce Rotation Forest and its implementation under the Spark framework are presented. The proposed MapReduce Rotation Forest behaves in the same way as the standard Rotation Forest, training the base classifiers on a rotated space, but using a functional implementation of the rotation that enables its execution in Big Data frameworks. Experimental results are obtained using different cloud-based cluster configurations. Bayesian tests are used to validate the method against two ensembles for Big Data: Random Forest and PCARDE classifiers. Our proposal incorporates the parallelization of both the PCA calculation and the tree training, providing a scalable solution that retains the performance of the original Rotation Forest and achieves a competitive execution time (in average, at training, more than 3 times faster than other PCA-based alternatives). In addition, extensive experimentation shows that by setting some parameters of the classifier (i.e., bootstrap sample size, number of trees, and number of rotations), the execution time is reduced with no significant loss of performance using a small ensemble.},

We propose an efficient iterative proximal algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Statistical convergence rates and selection consistency for the doubly sparse regularized estimator are established in the ultra-high dimensional setting.

  abstract     = {The ground station scheduling problem is a complex scheduling problem involving multiple objectives. Evolutionary techniques for multi-objective optimization are becoming popular among different fields, due to their effectiveness in obtaining a set of trade-off solutions. In contrast to some conventional methods, that aggregate the objectives into one weighted-sum objective function, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms manage to find a set of solutions in the Pareto-optimal front. Selecting one algorithm, however, for a specific problem adds additional challenge. In this paper the ground station scheduling problem was solved through six different evolutionary multi-objective algorithms, the NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA2, GDE3, IBEA, and MOEA/D. The goal is to test their efficacy and performance to a number of benchmark static instances of the ground scheduling problem. Benchmark instances are of different sizes, allowing further testing of the behavior of the algorithms to different dimensionality of the problem. The solutions are compared to the recent solutions of a weighted-sum approach solved by the GA. The results show that all multi-objective algorithms manage to find as good solution as the weighted-sum, while giving more additional alternatives. The decomposition-based MOEA/D outperforms the rest of the algorithms for the specific problem in almost all aspects.},

  abstract  = {There is growing awareness that errors in the model equations cannot be ignored in data assimilation methods such as four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var). If allowed for, more information can be extracted from observations, longer time windows are possible, and the minimization process is easier, at least in principle. Weak constraint 4D-Var estimates the model error and minimizes a series of linear least-squares cost functions using the conjugate gradient (CG) method; minimising each cost function is called an inner loop. CG needs preconditioning to improve its performance. In previous work, limited memory preconditioners (LMPs) have been constructed using approximations of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian in the previous inner loop. If the Hessian changes signicantly in consecutive inner loops, the LMP may be of limited usefulness. To circumvent this, we propose using randomised methods for low rank eigenvalue decomposition and use these approximations to cheaply construct LMPs using information from the current inner loop. Three randomised methods are compared. Numerical experiments in idealized systems show that the resulting LMPs perform better than the existing LMPs. Using these methods may allow more efficient and robust implementations of incremental weak constraint 4D-Var.},

The unstructured data of digital hyperspace can be elegantly represented, traversed, and transformed via the mathematics of hypergraphs, hypersparse matrices, and associative array algebra. This paper explores a novel mathematical concept, the semilink, that combines pairs of semirings to provide the essential operations for graph analytics, database operations, and machine learning. The GraphBLAS standard currently supports hypergraphs, hypersparse matrices, the mathematics required for semilinks, and seamlessly performs graph, network, and matrix operations. With the addition of key based indices (such as pointers to strings) and semilinks, GraphBLAS can become a richer associative array algebra and be a plug-in replacement for spreadsheets, database tables, and data centric operating systems, enhancing the navigation of unstructured data found in digital hyperspace.},

We establish global convergence to a first-order stationary point when $f$ satisfies a smoothness condition that holds, in particular, when it has Lipschitz-continuous gradient, and $h$ is proper and lower semi-continuous. The model of $h$ is required to be proper, lower-semi-continuous and prox-bounded. Under these weak assumptions, we establish a worst-case $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity bound that matches the best known complexity bound of standard trust-region methods for smooth optimization. We detail a special instance in which we use a limited-memory quasi-Newton model of $f$ and compute a step with the proximal gradient method, resulting in a practical proximal quasi-Newton method. We establish similar convergence properties and complexity bound for a quadratic regularization variant, and provide an interpretation as a proximal gradient method with adaptive step size for nonconvex problems. We describe our Julia implementations and report numerical results on inverse problems from sparse optimization and signal processing. Our trust-region algorithm exhibits promising performance and compares favorably with linesearch proximal quasi-Newton methods based on convex models.},

Accomplishing such a task in a centralized fashion in networks is prone to a number of issues such as large power consumption, congestion at certain nodes and suffers from robustness issues against possible node failures. Decentralized subspace projection is an alternative method to address those issues. Recently, it has been shown that graph filters (GFs) can be implemented to perform decentralized subspace projection. However, most of the existing methods have focused on designing GFs for symmetric topologies. However, in this paper, motivated by the typical scenario of asymmetric communications in Wireless Sensor Networks, we study the optimal design of graph shift operators to perform decentralized subspace projection for asymmetric topologies. Firstly, the existence of feasible solutions (graph shift operators) to achieve an exact projection is characterized, and then an optimization problem is proposed to obtain the shift operator. We also provide an ADMM-based decentralized algorithm for the design of the shift operator. A necessary condition for the existence of an exact subspace projection solution is also provided in terms of network connectivity. In the case where achieving an exact projection is not feasible due to the sparse connectivity, we provide an efficient solution to compute the projection matrix with high accuracy by using a set of parallel graph filters. Numerical results show the benefits of the proposed methods, as compared to the currently existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Synchronization-free SpTRSVs, due to their short preprocessing time and high performance, are the most popular SpTRSV algorithms. However, we observe that the performance of those SpTRSVs on different matrices can vary greatly. Our further studies show that when the average number of components per level is high and the average number of nonzero elements per row is low, those SpTRSVs exhibit extremely low performance. The reason is that, they use a warp on the GPU to process a row in sparse matrices, and such warp-level designs have severe underutilization of the GPU. To solve this problem, we propose YuenyeungSpTRSV, a thread-level and wrap-level fusion synchronization-free SpTRSV, which handles the rows with a large number of nonzero elements at warp-level while the rows with a low number of nonzero elements at thread-level. It can achieve good performance on the most popular sparse matrix storage, compressed sparse row format, and thus users do not need to conduct format conversion. We evaluate YuenyeungSpTRSV with 245 matrices from the Florida Sparse Matrix Collection on four platforms, and experiments show that our SpTRSV exhibits 7.14 GFLOPS/s, which is 5.98x speedup over the state-of-the-art synchronization-free SpTRSV.},

The standard approach consists in performing an iterative search for the shift akin to solving the secular equation in trust-region methods. Such search requires computing the Cholesky factorization of a tentative shifted Hessian at each iteration, which limits the size of problems that can be reasonably considered. We propose a scalable implementation of ARC named ARCqK in which we solve a set of shifted systems concurrently by way of an appropriate modification of the Lanczos formulation of the conjugate gradient (CG) method. At each iteration of ARCqK to solve a problem with n variables, a range of m << n shift parameters is selected. The computational overhead in CG beyond the Lanczos process is thirteen scalar operations to update five vectors of length m and two n-vector updates for each value of the shift. The CG variant only requires one Hessian-vector product and one dot product per iteration, independently of the number of shift parameters. Solves corresponding to inadequate shift parameters are interrupted early. All shifted systems are solved inexactly. Such modest cost makes our implementation scalable and appropriate for large-scale problems. We provide a new analysis of the inexact ARC method including its worst case evaluation complexity, global and asymptotic convergence. We describe our implementation and provide preliminary numerical observations that confirm that for problems of size at least 100, our implementation of ARCqK is more efficient than a classic Steihaug-Toint trust region method. Finally, we generalize our convergence results to inexact Hessians and nonlinear least-squares problems.},

  abstract    = {Gauss-Seidel (GS) relaxation is often employed as a preconditioner for a Krylov solver or as a smoother for Algebraic Multigrid (AMG). However, the requisite sparse triangular solve is difficult to parallelize on many-core architectures such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In the present study, the performance of the traditional GS relaxation based on a triangular solve is compared with two-stage variants, replacing the direct triangular solve with a fixed number of inner Jacobi-Richardson (JR) iterations. When a small number of inner iterations is sufficient to maintain the Krylov convergence rate, the two-stage GS (GS2) often outperforms the traditional algorithm on many-core architectures. We also compare GS2 with JR. When they perform the same number of flops for SpMV (e.g. three JR sweeps compared to two GS sweeps with one inner JR sweep), the GS2 iterations, and the Krylov solver preconditioned with GS2, may converge faster than the JR iterations. Moreover, for some problems (e.g. elasticity), it was found that JR may diverge with a damping factor of one, whereas two-stage GS may improve the convergence with more inner iterations. Finally, to study the performance of the two-stage smoother and preconditioner for a practical problem, (e.g. using tuned damping factors), these were applied to incompressible fluid flow simulations on GPUs.},

  abstract    = {Since the advent of the Internet, quantifying the relative importance of web pages is at the core of search engine methods. According to one algorithm, PageRank, the worldwide web structure is represented by the Google matrix, whose principal eigenvector components assign a numerical value to web pages for their ranking. Finding such a dominant eigenvector on an ever-growing number of web pages becomes a computationally intensive task incompatible with Moore's Law. We demonstrate that special-purpose optical machines such as networks of optical parametric oscillators, lasers, and gain-dissipative condensates, may aid in accelerating the reliable reconstruction of principal eigenvectors of real-life web graphs. We discuss the feasibility of simulating the PageRank algorithm on large Google matrices using such unconventional hardware. We offer alternative rankings based on the minimisation of spin Hamiltonians. Our estimates show that special-purpose optical machines may provide dramatic improvements in power consumption over classical computing architectures.},

  abstract     = {In today’s world, the applications of convolutional neural networks (CNN) are limitless and are employed in numerous fields. The CNNs get wider and deeper to achieve near-human accuracy. Implementing such networks on resource constrained hardware is a cumbersome task. CNNs need to be optimized both on hardware and algorithmic levels to compress and fit into resource limited devices. This survey aims to investigate different optimization techniques of Vision CNNs, both on algorithmic and hardware level, which would help in efficient hardware implementation, especially for FPGAs.}
